He was an illegitimate son of Ail\u00e9an mac Ruaidhr\u00ed, and is recorded to have participated in the kindred's military actions against supporters of both the English Crown and Scottish Crown. Following the apparent death of his brother, Lachlann, Ruaidhr\u00ed appears to have taken control of the kindred, and firmly aligned the family with Robert I, King of Scotland. Ruaidhr\u00ed may well be the member of Clann Ruaidhr\u00ed who is recorded slain at the Battle of Faughart in support of the Bruce cause in Ireland. After his death, Ruaidhr\u00ed's half-sister, Cairist\u00edona, attempted to transfer the Clann Ruaidhr\u00ed territories outwith the family. Ruaidhr\u00ed was survived by a daughter, \u00c1ine, and an illegitimate son, Raghnall. The latter fended off Cairist\u00edona's actions and succeeded to the chiefship of Clann Ruaidhr\u00ed."}

Raghnall's father, Ruaidhr\u00ed Mac Ruaidhr\u00ed, appears to have been slain in 1318, at a time when Raghnall may have been under age. Ruaidhr\u00ed himself appears to have faced resistance over the Clann Ruaidhr\u00ed lordship from his sister, Cairist\u00edona, wife of Donnchadh, a member of the comital family of Mar. Following Ruaidhr\u00ed's demise, there is evidence indicating that Cairist\u00edona and her powerful confederates also posed a threat to the young Raghnall. Nevertheless, Raghnall eventually succeeded to his father, and first appears on record in 1337. Raghnall's possession of his family's expansive ancestral territories in the Hebrides and West Highlands put him in conflict with the neighbouring magnate William III, Earl of Ross, and contention between the two probably contributed to Raghnall's assassination at the hands of the earl's adherents in 1346. Following his death, the Clann Ruaidhr\u00ed territories passed through his sister, \u00c1ine, into the possession of her husband, the chief of Clann Domhnaill, E\u00f3in Mac Domhnaill I, Lord of the Isles, resulting in the latter's consolidation of power in the Hebrides as Lord of the Isles."}

He is best known for his solo career during which he has released 16 albums, as well as three studio albums as a former member of rock/alternative country band Whiskeytown. In 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, \"Heartbreaker\", to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the Shortlist Music Prize. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold \"Gold\", which included the hit single, \"New York, New York\". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, \"Demolition\" (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the classic rock-influenced \"Rock N Roll\" (2003), after a planned album, \"Love Is Hell\", was rejected by his label Lost Highway. As a compromise, \"Love Is Hell\" was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004. After breaking his wrist during a live performance, Adams took a short-lived break, and formed The Cardinals, a backing band that accompanied him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, after the release of \"Cardinology\" (2009), Adams disbanded The Cardinals and announced an extended break from music due to complications from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. The following year, however, Adams resumed performing and released his Glyn Johns-produced thirteenth studio album, \"Ashes & Fire\", in late 2011. The album peaked at No. 7 on the \"Billboard\" 200. In September 2014, Adams released his fourteenth album, \"Ryan Adams\", on his own PAX AM label, and formed a new backing band, The Shining, to support the release. In 2015, Adams released \"1989\", a song-for-song cover of Taylor Swift's album of the same name, and worked on up to eighty songs for an album influenced by his divorce from actress and singer-songwriter Mandy Moore. The album, \"Prisoner\", was released in 2017. In 2019, Adams announced three albums to be released that year. However, the release of these albums was cancelled after several women, including a minor, came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Adams. In addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for Willie Nelson, Jesse Malin, Jenny Lewis, and Fall Out Boy, and has collaborated with Counting Crows, Weezer, Norah Jones, America, Minnie Driver, Cowboy Junkies, Leona Naess, Toots and the Maytals, Beth Orton and Krista Polvere.

Encouraged by the financiers to make the story her own, Barnard changed the location of the film to Yorkshire, and instead focused on a woman who returns to the home she fled 15 years earlier in order to claim the tenancy of her father's farm, who then becomes involved in a dispute with her brother.

The younger son of the Earl of Portsmouth, he briefly sat in Parliament on a family interest and later died in captivity in France during the Napoleonic Wars. Wallop was the third son of John Wallop, 2nd Earl of Portsmouth. He was educated at Eton from 1785 to 1792. On 29 April 1794, he was commissioned a captain of volunteers in the South Hampshire militia, and was given the captaincy of one of the permanent companies of the regiment on 4 April 1795. Wallop resigned his commission on 24 July 1799. Wallop was returned for Andover in 1796 on his father's electoral interest. He made little mark in Parliament and supported, at his father's direction, the Pitt ministry. However, he was apparently somewhat mentally deficient, like his eldest brother Viscount Lymington. John King, who had ambitions to enter Parliament, wrote Pitt in 1800 to say that Wallop was \"little better than an idiot\" and \"has spent all his money,\" so that his mother was willing to put up another candidate for Andover if a pension of \u00a3400 a year could be obtained for him. Pitt declined, and Wallop sat in Parliament until the next election, in 1802, when he was replaced by his elder brother Newton. On 2 April 1802, he married Catherine Townley Keatinge, the only daughter of Maurice Keatinge. He took the opportunity of the Peace of Amiens to travel to France, but was detained at Verdun when war broke out again in 1803. While there, he was alleged to have carried on an affair with the wife of another English detainee, which prompted the French authorities to remove him to the fortress of Bitche in February 1805. He was returned to Verdun in May 1806, but his health had suffered badly, and he died suddenly of apoplexy on 31 August 1807. He left no children."}

A longtime prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Prime Minister Tage Erlander, Palme led the Swedish Social Democratic Party from 1969 until his assassination in 1986, and was twice Prime Minister of Sweden, heading a Privy Council Government from 1969 to 1976 and a cabinet government from 1982 until his death. Electoral defeats in 1976 and 1979 marked the end of Social Democratic hegemony in Swedish politics, which had seen 40 years of unbroken rule by the party. While leader of the opposition, he parted domestic and international interests and served as special mediator of the United Nations in the Iran\u2013Iraq War, and was President of the Nordic Council in 1979. He returned as Prime Minister after electoral victories in 1982 and 1985. Palme was a pivotal and polarizing figure domestically as well as in international politics from the 1960s. He was steadfast in his non-alignment policy towards the superpowers, accompanied by support for numerous third world liberation movements following decolonization including, most controversially, economic and vocal support for a number of Third World governments. He was the first Western head of government to visit Cuba after its revolution, giving a speech in Santiago praising contemporary Cuban and Cambodian revolutionaries. Frequently a critic of United States and Soviet foreign policy , he resorted to fierce and often polarizing criticism in pinpointing his resistance towards imperialist ambitions and authoritarian regimes, including those of Francisco Franco of Spain, Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar of Portugal and Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k of Czechoslovakia, as well as John Vorster and P. W. Botha of South Africa. His 1972 condemnation of the Hanoi bombings, notably comparing the tactic to the Treblinka extermination camp, resulted in a temporary freeze in Sweden\u2013United States relations. Palme's murder on a Stockholm street on 28 February 1986 was the first assassination of a national leader in Sweden since Gustav III in 1792, and had a great impact across Scandinavia. Local convict and addict Christer Pettersson was originally convicted of the murder in district court but was acquitted on appeal to the Svea Court of Appeal."}

He is one of the best- selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the\" bobby soxers\". He released his debut album,\" The Voice of Frank Sinatra\", in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of\" From Here to Eternity\", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including\" In the Wee Small Hours\"( 1955),\" Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\"( 1956),\" Come Fly with Me\"( 1958),\" Only the Lonely\"( 1958) and\" Nice' n' Easy\"( 1960). Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album,\" September of My Years\" and starred in the Emmy- winning television special. After releasing\" Sinatra at the Sands\", recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album\" Francis Albert Sinatra& Antonio Carlos Jobim\".

He appeared in various musicals such as\" On the Town\"( 1949),\" Guys and Dolls\"( 1955),\" High Society\"( 1956), and\" Pal Joey\"( 1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter.

DeMille Award in 1971. On television,\" The Frank Sinatra Show\" began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. In crime, Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia. While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music.

Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, and was later promoted to major general. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline. Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career. He died near Helena, Arkansas in 1878; initially buried in Helena, Pillow was later reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis."}

{"question_id": "bbf421ca5f82d00b0df67a6223e3c35b", "title": "Place of birth", "context": "The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place."}

Schwartz was born in Romny in the Ukrainian SSR in 1923. His family moved to Leningrad in 1930, where he learned to play the piano. He gave his first concert in 1935 with the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. Schwartz's father was professor of archeology at the Leningrad State University: he was arrested in 1936 and executed two years later as part of the Great Purge. Schwartz's family was exiled to Kyrgyzstan in 1937, and Schwartz gave private music lessons in Frunze (now Bishkek) as well as occasionally accompanying the silent films at the cinema with live music. During the Second World War, Schwartz directed one of the sections of the Red Army Choir. During that time, he met Mariya Dmitriyevna, the sister of Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who introduced him to her brother. Shostakovich helped Schwartz gain entry to the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory in Leningrad, from whence he graduated with a diploma in composition in 1951. He joined the Union of Soviet Composers in 1955. Only years later did he discover that Shostakovich had paid for his education. When Shostakovich was dismissed from the Conservatory, Schwartz was asked to denounce Shostakovich, but he refused. Schwartz's first major commission was the music for the film \"Our Correspondent\" in 1959. He went on to compose the music for more than 100 Soviet films, including \"White Sun of the Desert\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043d\u0438\", 1969) and \"The Captivating Star of Happiness\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\", 1975). Perhaps his best known work outside of the Soviet Union was for Akira Kurosawa's 1975 film \"Dersu Uzala\". He won the prestigious Nika Award of the Russian Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences for 1992 for his music for the films \"White King, Red Queen\u0411\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\") and \"Luna Park\u041b\u0443\u043d\u0430-\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\"). Schwartz also composed music for ballets and theatrical performances and, to a lesser extent, for television. His one symphony, \"Gelbe Sterne \u2013 Purimspiel im Ghetto\", was first performed in Saint Petersburg in 2000: it was inspired by the story of the Kovno Ghetto in Lithuania. Schwartz died in Siversky, near Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation, on 27 December 2009, aged 86."}

His grandfather, Johann Frederick I, had still held the title of Elector of Saxony, but after the Battle of M\u00fchlberg he lost the title to his cousin Maurice, from the Albertine line. His father tried since then to regain the Electorate again for the Ernestine line. For this purpose he accepted an outlawed knight, Wilhelm von Grumbach, with himself, which led finally to the fact that also over his father the anger of the Emperor. Only one year after his birth was besieged the castle of his father in Gotha by troops of the Elector Augustus of Saxony and finally conquered. His father came into imperial prison from the rest of his life. His mother, Johann Ernst and his older brothers had to flee from Gotha. They found first admission with his uncle, the duke Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar, who took over also the guardianship for the princes -at the same time, he was granted by the Emperor with the lands of his brother Johann Frederick II-. After a short time in Weimar, Johann Ernst, as well as his mother and his brothers, lived in Eisenach and Eisenberg. Later, his uncle Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar lost the Imperial favour. In the Diet of Speyer (1570), the Emperor decided to restore to the three sons of Johann Frederick II his hereditary rights. In 1572 his older brother Frederick Heinrich died from typhus fever. The same year, by the Division of Erfurt, the decision of the Diet of Speyer was made: The lands of his father were extracted again from the duchy of Saxe-Weimar, and created from them the new \"Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach\". Johann Ernst and his older surviving brother, Johann Casimir, were made rulers of the new country. During there minority, the lands were under the guardianship of the three Elector Princes: Frederick III of the Palatinate (also his maternal grandfather), Johann George of Brandenburg and Augustus of Saxony; also, they took the regency over Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach.

With only six years, Johann Ernst was separated from his parents forever and entrusted to the education of strange persons. Since 1578 he visited the University of Leipzig then together with his brother. In 1586, after the wedding of his brother with Anna of Saxony, the daughter of the Elector Augustus, the guardianship finalized, and Johann Casimir began, together with his brother, the independent ruling of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. Johann Casimir and Johann Ernst governed together the principality for the next ten years; however, Johann Casimir carried the main responsibility for the government as an older brother. Also, in order to had a separated residence from his brother too, Johann Ernst establishes himself in the small town of Marksuhl on 1587. Since 1590 Johann Ernst withdrew himself from the government of the duchy, with his brother completely agreed it, that this should govern the duchy for five years alone, when this time had elapsed and finally agreed (in 1596) with its brother to a new divisionary treaty. The duchy of Saxe-Eisenach was taken by Johann Ernst as independent principality separated from Saxe-Coburg, who remained with Johann Casimir. Thus, Saxe-Eisenach, for the first time in his history, had his own independent political unit became within the Holy Roman Empire. During his first year of reign, Johann Ernst still live in Marsuhl because Eisenach, the new capital of his country, was inhabited and, only with the establishment of his official residence the citizens began to moved there. In 1598 Johann Ernst created for his duchy his own \"Landesregierung\" (Federal State Government) and a\" Konsistorium\". In 1633 his brother, the duke Johann Casimir of Saxe-Coburg, died childless.

Of Belgian aristocratic descent, he attained a brief prominence in the English- speaking world through his conversion to Anglicanism in 1962. De Mendieta was born in Bouvignes- sur- Meuse in 1907 and entered the novitiate at Maredsous in 1925 \u2014 shortly before the Malines Conversations between Roman Catholics and Anglicans\u2014and was given the name of Dom David. He was professed in 1930. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1932. He became a noted patristics scholar and an international authority on St. Basil of Caesarea. In 1956 de Mendieta announced his conversion to the Church of England. He left Belgium and moved to Great Britain, where he was received into the Church. After several years of teaching at various smaller colleges, he was named a canon, that is a canon residentiary, of Winchester Cathedral and thus a member of the Cathedral Chapter. Of studious disposition his career at the cathedral reflected his monastic experience in his general lack of knowledge of some standard procedures of modern life. Publishing in several European languages, he continued to live a relatively secluded existence after his move to England. De Mendieta's acceptance of an office in the Anglican Church invited a journalist's comparison with the case of de Dominis' appointment to the Deanery of Windsor under King James I. It was also subsequently noted that the 20th- century cleric, Charles Davis, did not opt for a similar route when he left the Roman Catholic Church. ( Other distinguished early foreign appointments to Anglican canonries, but from Protestant backgrounds, were Isaac Casaubon, Gerrit and Isaac Vossius)."}

On 1932, while in New York City, Fernando Cort\u00e9s married Puerto Rican childhood friend Mar\u00eda del Pilar Cordero, who adopted the stage name of Mapy Cort\u00e9s. The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Fernando progressively began to take a backseat as actor and baritone and focused on promoting the career of his wife Mapy, who became a noted \"vedette\" (showgirl with star status) in Barcelona. After the Spanish Civil War interrupted their careers, the couple worked in New York, San Juan, Buenos Aires, Havana and Caracas, occasionally starring in movies. They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas. Despite early struggles to become household names, Mapy achieved Mexican film stardom in late 1941 and the couple settled in Mexico City. Initially, Fernando Cort\u00e9s played supporting roles in his wife's films. He then made a successful debut as director with \"La p\u00edcara Susana\" (1945) a comedy vehicle for his wife. On March 1954, Fernando and Mapy Cort\u00e9s returned to Puerto Rico to help launch local television. Cort\u00e9s became the first director at WKAQ-TV, Channel 2, and the couple co-starred in \"Mapy y Papi\", the first Puerto Rican sitcom. Despite their success on local TV, the couple returned the following year to Mexico City, which offered more opportunities. The couple starred in a Mexican version of their Puerto Rican sitcom and Mapy returned to the stage. Fernando Cort\u00e9s became known as a reliable director of Mexican comedies on stage, television and film. After writing and directing star vehicles for his wife Mapy in the 1940s and comedians like Resortes and Tin-Tan in the 1950s, Fernando Cort\u00e9s produced and directed Puerto Rican co-productions in the 1960s and launched the film career of La India Mar\u00eda in the 1970s."}

Before becoming involved with film, Genz attended Designskolen Kolding, where he studied graphic design, after giving up on an earlier dream of being a painter. While there, he did some work with video, and a chance meeting with director Arne Bro encouraged him to pursue film as a career. Genz was then accepted into the National Film School of Denmark at the age of 31, graduating after completing the well-regarded short film \"Cross Roads\" (Danish title: Omveje, \"Detours\") in 1995. Genz's next work, the short film \"Theis and Nico\" (Danish title: Bror, min bror, \"Brother, my brother\"), released in 1999, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. He then became involved with the Dogme 95 movement, but was unable to produce any quality work after six months of effort. Speaking later about his difficulty in trying to work under the Dogme restrictions, he described himself as a \"visual director\" and Dogme as a movement where \"the camera follows the [actors] and choice means nothing\". In 2003, Genz released his first feature film, an adaptation of the children's book \"Someone like Hodder\" (Danish title: \" En som Hodder\") by popular writer Bjarne Reuter. He followed it in 2005 with \"Chinaman\" (Danish title: \"Kinamand\"), a romantic comedy about a man who takes a foreign wife in an arranged marriage so that she can obtain permission for residency, and then falls in love with her. Genz returned to his roots in 2008, adapting (with Dunja Gry Jensen) a novel by fellow Gram native Erling Jepsen into the film \"Terribly Happy\". In their youths, Genz and Jepsen had been childhood acquaintances who lived across the street from one another. It won numerous awards, including the Crystal Globe at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival."}

Newton( November 13, 1969 \u2013 May 24, 2007) was an American murderer executed in the state of Ohio in 2007. Christopher Newton received the death penalty for the 2001 aggravated murder of his cellmate, Jason Brewer. At the time of the murder, Newton was imprisoned for attempted aggravated burglary of his father's home, an offense he committed a few weeks after his release from prison for a prior attempted aggravated burglary. Newton killed Brewer in their cell by stomping on his neck and head and strangling him with a strip of cloth. According to the opinion of the Ohio Supreme Court affirming the death penalty, Newton laughed while responding officials tried to resuscitate Brewer, having smeared Brewer's blood on his face and drunk some of it( stating,\" if he is not dead, I hope he is going to be a vegetable\"). Newton admitted that another inmate had hired him to assault Brewer, and that he was ready to die in prison and knew that murdering another inmate would warrant the death penalty. According to the Ohio Supreme Court, numerous psychiatrists and psychologists had examined Newton over the years, resulting in various diagnoses. At the capital trial, a defense psychologist testified that Newton had several mental health disorders, including\" mood disorder\" and symptoms of PTSD. In response, a government psychiatrist reviewed the mental health history and rebutted the defense expert. The court denied defense funds for neuropsychiatric tests to explore other types of mental disability. The trial was before a three- court panel of judges who, after hearing the evidence, imposed the death penalty. A controversy arose regarding the delay in Newton's execution, as at the time, which made administration of the injections difficult. It took over two hours and 10 attempts before the execution was completed. The problems with Newton's execution occurred one year after the 90 minute execution of fellow Ohio inmate, Joseph Lewis Clark."}

Hladnik was born in Kranj. He started with amateur short films after acquiring a projector and a 8mm camera in 1947. From 1949 he studied at the Academy for Theatre, Radio, Film and Television in Ljubljana and made a name for himself with several highly acclaimed short films. In 1957, Hladnik moved to Paris to apprentice under French filmmakers such as Claude Chabrol, Philipe de Broca, and Robert Siodmak. Hladnik's early-'60s features, Ples v de\u017eju (Dance in the Rain) (1961) and Pe\u0161\u010deni grad/Sand Castle (1962), influenced the course of Yugoslav cinema, through integrating influences from the nouvelle vague into it. Hladnik has an obsession with eroticism. He made many films dealing openly with sex and his Erotikon (1963), with its openly sensual approach to taboo sexual relationships, not only triggered angry protests in the press, but it also led to it being banned in some Yugoslav republics. Western European critics and public however, supported Hladnik enough for him to find foreign backing for his even more provocative feature film on sexuality, Ma\u0161karada/Masquerade(1971). Hladnik died in Ljubljana in 2006."}

The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny( Wiseau), his deceptive fianc\u00e9e Lisa( Danielle) and his conflicted best friend Mark( Sestero). A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events. The stage play from which the film is derived was so- called due to its events taking place in a single room. A number of publications have labeled\" The Room\" as one of the worst films ever made. An assistant professor of film studies was the first to describe\" The Room\" as\" the\" Citizen Kane\" of bad movies\". Originally shown only in a limited number of California theaters,\" The Room\" quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, and Wiseau's off- kilter performance. Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a black comedy, audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama, an opinion shared by some of the cast. \" The Disaster Artist\", Sestero's memoir of the making of\" The Room\", was co-written with Tom Bissell and published in 2013. A film of the same name based on the book, directed by and starring James Franco, was released on December 1, 2017; the book and film received widespread acclaim and numerous award nominations. \" The Room\" also inspired an unofficial video game adaptation,\" The Room Tribute\", released on Newgrounds in 2010."}

Juan Carlos is the grandson of Alfonso XIII, the last king of Spain before the abolition of the monarchy in 1931 and the subsequent declaration of the Second Spanish Republic. Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, during his family's exile. \" General\u00edsimo\" Francisco Franco took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, yet in 1947 Spain's status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. Juan Carlos's father, Juan, was the third son of King Alfonso, who had renounced his claims to the throne in January 1941. Juan was seen by Franco to be too liberal and in 1969 was bypassed in favour of Juan Carlos as Franco's successor as head of state. Juan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza. Later, he attended the Naval Military School, the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in Athens. The couple had two daughters and a son together: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe. Due to Franco's declining health, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain's head of state in the summer of 1974. Franco died in November the following year and Juan Carlos became king on 22 November 1975, two days after Franco's death, the first reigning monarch since 1931; although his exiled father did not formally renounce his claims to the throne in favor of his son until 1977. Expected to continue Franco's legacy, Juan Carlos, however, soon after his accession introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and begin the Spanish transition to democracy. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum, which re-established a constitutional monarchy. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert Spain to Francoist government in the King's name. In 2008, he was considered the most popular leader in all Ibero- America. Hailed for his role in Spain's transition to democracy, the King and the monarchy's reputation began to suffer after controversies surrounding his family arose, exacerbated by an elephant- hunting trip he undertook during a time of financial crisis in Spain. In 2014, Juan Carlos, citing personal reasons, abdicated in favour of his son, who acceded to the throne as Felipe VI."}

Nicknamed the \"Father of Rock and Roll\", Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as \"Maybellene\" (1955), \" Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded \"Maybellene\"\u2014Berry's adaptation of the country song \"Ida Red\"\u2014which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on \"Billboard\" magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. However, he was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act\u2014he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more hits, including \"No Particular Place to GoYou Never Can Tell\", and \"Nadine\". But these did not achieve the same success, or lasting impact, of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality. However, in 1972 he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of \"My Ding-a-Ling\" became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion. Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having \"laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance. \" Berry is included in several of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's \"greatest of all time\" lists; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berry's: \"Johnny B. GoodeMaybellene\", and \"Rock and Roll Music\". Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode\" is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record."}

Her 47-year rule over Sark, in the Channel Islands, spanned the reigns of four Monarchs: George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II. Hathaway was a financially troubled widow with six children when she succeeded her eccentric father, William Frederick Collings, as feudal lady of Sark. She immediately set about reinforcing her feudal rights and promoting tourism on the island, which she affectionately called \"the last bastion of feudalism\". When she remarried in 1929, her second husband, Robert Hathaway, legally became her senior co-ruler, but she kept control of the government. Hathaway's tenure saw the German occupation of the Channel Islands in the Second World War, during which she refused to evacuate and convinced the islanders to stay as well. Her eldest son and heir apparent, Francis William Beaumont, was killed in 1941, while her husband was deported to an internment camp in 1943. Hathaway remains best known for her indomitable conduct during the occupation. After the war, she continued her publicity campaign, strengthening the island's tourism industry.

An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays mentioning Socrates during Socrates' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' \"Travel Journal\" provides important information about Socrates' youth. Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, from which Socrates has become renowned for his contributions to the fields of ethics and epistemology. It is this who lends his name to the concepts of Socratic irony and the Socratic method, or \"elenchus.\" However, questions remain regarding the distinction between the real-life Socrates and Plato's portrayal of Socrates in his dialogues. Socrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later antiquity and in the modern era. Depictions of Socrates in art, literature and popular culture have made him one of the most widely known figures in the Western philosophical tradition."}

He was for some time a clerk in the Railway Clearing House, and began about 1891 to write humorous sketches for the\" St James's Gazette\" and other papers. He published first novel was\" A Clever Wife\"( 1895), but he secured his first striking success with his fifth,\" Mord Em'ly\"( 1898), an excellent example of his ability to draw humorous portraits of lower class life. In 1924, fellow novelist Edwin Pugh recalled his early memories of Pett Ridge in the 1890s: Pett Ridge was a compassionate man, giving generously of both his time and money to charity. He founded the Babies Home at Hoxton in 1907 and was an ardent supporter of many organisations that had the welfare of children as their object. This charitable zeal, and the fact that he established himself as the leading novelist of London life and character, led to him being characterised as the natural successor of Dickens. All his friends considered Pett Ridge to be one of life's natural bachelors. They were rather surprised therefore in 1909 when he married Olga Hentschel. Four of his books, including\" Mord Em'ly\", were adapted as films in the early 1920s, all with scripts by Eliot Stannard. Pett Ridge's great popularity as a novelist in the early part of the century declined in the latter years of his life. His work was considered to be rather old fashioned, though he still wrote and had published at least one book in each year in the final decade of his life. His last work,\" Led by Westmacott\", was published in the year after his death. William Pett Ridge died, aged 71, at his home, Ampthill, Willow Grove, Chislehurst, on 29 September 1930 and was cremated at West Norwood on 2 October 1930. His ashes were taken away by his surviving family, his wife, a son and a daughter."}

His surname was Doria, but since he belonged to the ruling house of Arborea he is often dynastically called Bas-Serra, or Doria-Bas. Younger brother and successor of Frederick, he was a minor upon his succession and was under the tutelage of his mother Eleanor. He was born at Castel Genovese (modern Castelsardo) between 1378 and 1379 to Eleanor and Brancaleone Doria, a Genoese nobleman. In 1383, he was proclaimed judge along with his brother, Frederick of Arborea. In 1387, his brother died under Aragonese captivity and Marianus became sole judge at a time when the Giudicato of Arborea was at war with the Crown of Aragon. On 24 January 1388, Eleanor signed a pact with Aragon which brought peace and safeguarded Marianus' rule. On 16 August 1391, Marianus accompanied his father at the occupation of Sassari and Osilo. Marianus was 14 years old in 1392 when his mother promulgated the Carta de Logu and he was declared of age. He immediately reaffirmed the treaty with Aragon, but the real power at that time lay with Brancaleone. Eleanor died in 1404. He died of bubonic plague three years later without heirs, presenting a succession crisis."}

He was a scion of an influential family (the Doria) of the Republic of Genoa, the son of the elder Brancaleone and a woman named Giacomina. On 16 March 1357, he became a vassal of Peter IV of Aragon, the nominal King of Sardinia, to legitimate the possessions of his father on the island. When Hugh III of Arborea, Eleanor's brother, sought out a matrimonial alliance with Genoa, his choice for a brother-in-law fell on Brancaleone. The marriage took place in 1376, a political alliance only, for the Bas-Serra family of Eleanor was opposed to the royal pretensions of the House of Barcelona, to which Brancaleone was affiliated. Already at the time of his marriage, he had illegitimate children, Giannettino and Nicholas, by an anonymous woman. When Hugh was assassinated in 1383, Eleanor and Brancaleone's young son Frederick succeeded to the Giudicato of Arborea. At that time, Brancaleone was in Catalonia to receive the honorific title of \"Count of Monteleone and Baron of Lower Marmilla. \" As soon as Peter IV heard of the election of Frederick, he arrested Brancaleone and sent him to Cagliari, to be imprisoned first in the tower of Pancrazio and then in that of Elefante. Arborea was governed in the meantime by Eleanor. Frederick, later seized and imprisoned by Peter himself, died young and in captivity. He was succeeded by Brancaleone's second son, Marianus V. Brancaleone was finally liberated only on 1 January 1390. His fidelity to the Aragonese crown was by then broken. On 1 April 1391, Brancaleone marched on Castel di Cagliari and, on 16 August, occupied Sassari and Osilo with his son Marianus. In September, he conquered the castles of Fava, Galtell\u00ec, Bonveh\u00ec, and Pedreso. Only Alghero and Longosardo remained in Aragonese hands by then. On 3 October, he entered Villa di Chiesa. In a letter written at Sanluri on 3 February 1392, he announced having repossessed all the territories lost to the Aragonese in 1388. On 16 March, a fleet under Martin of Aragon appeared off Capo San Marco, conducted from Sicily for the purpose of putting down Brancaleone's \"rebellion.\" The attempt failed. Following Marianus' death, Arborea passed to William III of Narbonne. Brancaleone retired to his estates at Monteleone. He disappears from the record mysteriously before the Battle of Sanluri in 1409."}

A symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel is one of the world's most prestigious and best known hotels. It is a member of the international consortium, The Leading Hotels of the World. Over the course of its history the Ritz has become so associated with luxury and elegance that the word\" ritzy\" has entered the English language to denote something that is ostentatiously stylish, fancy, or fashionable. The hotel was opened by Swiss hotelier C\u00e9sar Ritz in May 1906, eight years after he established the H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris. After a weak beginning, the hotel began to gain popularity towards the end of World War I, and became popular with politicians, socialites, writers and actors of the day in particular. David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings at the Ritz during the latter half of the war, and it was at the Ritz that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against Turkey. No\u00ebl Coward was a notable diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s. Owned by the Bracewell- Smith family for a period until 1976, The Ellerman Group of Companies purchased the hotel for \u00a3 80 million from Trafalgar House in October 1995. They spent eight years and \u00a3 40 million restoring it to its former grandeur. In 2002, it became the first hotel to receive a Royal warrant from the Prince of Wales for its banquet and catering services. The exterior is both structurally and visually Franco- American in style with little trace of English architecture, and is heavily influenced by the architectural traditions of Paris. The facade on the Piccadilly side is roughly, on the Arlington Street side, and on the Green Park side. At the corners of the pavilion roofs of the Ritz are large green copper lions, the emblem of the hotel. The Ritz has 111 rooms and 25 suites. The Ritz Club, owned by the owners of the Ritz Hotel since 1998, is a casino in the basement of the hotel, occupying the space which was formerly the Ritz Bar and Grill. It offers roulette, black jack, baccarat, and poker, as well as some slot machines. The interior was designed mainly by London and Paris based designers in the Louis XVI style, which is consistent throughout. Author Marcus Binney describes the great suite of ground- floor rooms as\" one of the all- time masterpieces of hotel architecture\" and compares it to a royal palace with its\" grand vistas, lofty proportions and sparkling chandeliers\". The Ritz's most widely known facility is the Palm Court, which hosts the famous\" Tea at the Ritz\". It is an opulently decorated cream- coloured Louis XVI setting, with panelled mirrors in gilt bronze frames. The hotel has six private dining rooms, the Marie Antoinette Suite, with its\" boiserie\", and the rooms within the Grade II* listed William Kent House. The Rivoli Bar, built in the Art Deco style, was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy, to resemble the bar on the Orient Express."}

Kim was born in Seoul during the colonial period, raised in Pyongyang, where he became interested in theater and cinema. In Korea after the end of World War II, he studied dentistry while becoming involved in the theater. During the Korean War, he made propaganda films for the United States Information Service. In 1955, he used discarded movie equipments to produce his first two films. With the success of these two films Kim formed his own production company and produced popular melodramas for the rest of the decade. Kim Ki-young's first expression of his mature style was in his\" The Housemaid\"( 1960), which featured a powerful\" femme fatale\" character. It is widely considered to be one of the best Korean films of all time. After a\" Golden Age\" during the 1960s, the 1970s were a low- point in the history of Korean cinema because of governmental censorship and a decrease in audience attendance. Nevertheless, working independently, Kim produced some of his most eccentric cinematic creations in this era. Films such as\" Insect Woman\"( 1972) and\" Iodo\"( 1977) were successful at the time and highly influential on the younger generations of South Korean filmmakers both at their time of release, and with their rediscovery years later. By the 1980s, Kim's popularity had gone into decline, and his output decreased in the second half of the decade. Neglected by the mainstream during much of the 1990s, Kim became a cult figure in South Korean film Internet forums in the early 1990s. Widespread international interest in his work was stimulated by a career retrospective at the 1997 Pusan International Film Festival. He was preparing a comeback film when he and his wife were killed in a house fire in 1998. The Berlin International Film Festival gave Kim a posthumous retrospective in 1998, and the French Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que screened 18 of Kim's films, some newly rediscovered and restored, in 2006. Through the efforts of the Korean Film Council( KOFIC), previously lost films by Kim Ki- young continue to be rediscovered and restored. Many current prominent South Korean filmmakers, including directors Im Sang- soo, Kim Ki-duk, Bong Joon- ho and Park Chan- wook, claim Kim Ki- young as an influence on their careers."}

His identity with any king of Tara from Irish legend remains uncertain because his epithet is unique in the surviving corpus. However, three candidates have recently been proposed, the most likely being D\u00e1ire Doimthech, a well known king of Tara from Irish legend. His kindred, the D\u00e1irine or Corcu Lo\u00edgde, believed to be related to the \u00c9rainn, provided a number of powerful kings of Tara in the early period, and this could not be ignored by the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill compilers of the list. A descendant( or ancestor) of D\u00e1ire Doimthech, Mac Con moccu Lugaid Lo\u00edgde, is also listed in\" BCC\". D\u00e1ire Doimthech is also called D\u00e1ire S\u00edrchr\u00e9chtach or S\u00edrdr\u00e9chtach often in the tales and genealogies, where he is prominent as an ancestral figure. On the other hand, he is regarded as an ancestor deity of the \u00c9rainn by scholars following the theories of T. F. O'Rahilly. The alternative candidates are first D\u00e1ire mac Cormaic, a son of the famous Cormac mac Airt, an early ancestor of the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. Nowhere mentioned in legend as a king of Tara, he is only proposed on the basis of\" BCC\" apparently exhibiting bias in favour of D\u00e1l Cuinn candidates. The second is D\u00e1ire Barrach son of Cathair M\u00f3r, eponymous ancestor of the U\u00ed Bairrche, a Laigin dynasty. Although also nowhere described as a king of Tara, it is also recognized that overlordship of the region in which it lays was won from the Laigin by the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, and that a number of Laigin kings of Tara are probably missing from\" BCC\". At the same time this anti-Laiginian bias may make D\u00e1ire Barrach the least likely candidate. On the other hand, his son Muiredach Sn\u00edthe and grandson M\u00f3enach are listed as kings of Tara in the Leinster regnal poem\" Nidu d\u00edr dermait\". But see also Laidcenn mac Bairchid."}

The film was based on the characters Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne, who made their first appearance in the\" Sandesh\" magazine in 1915, with illustrations by Ray's grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. In 1961, after the revival of\" Sandesh\", Ray began contemplating the idea of making a film based on that story, and he was partly compelled by his son Sandip to make a film which was less' grim and adult'. This was matched by Ray's own desire to make a movie that, unlike his previous movies, would cater to children. Plus this would also give him an opportunity to lace the story with music and dancing, a point his movies' producers and distributors were always insisting upon. Ray managed to convince producers to finance the movie, even though it was clear from the beginning that the film would cost a lot of money. The movie released to great critical and commercial reception, which held the record for longest continuous run of a Bengali- language movie in Bengal, as it ran for 51 straight weeks. It won the Best Feature Film and Best Direction awards at the 16th National Film Awards, and went on to win many other international awards as well. Critical reception was highly positive.

Despite his humble origin, he was one of Octavian \u2019s best friends, along with Marcus Agrippa. Salvidienus and Agrippa were with Octavian at Apollonia in March 44 BC when Julius Caesar was assassinated in Rome. Salvidienus became one of the most trusted of Octavian \u2019s generals during the civil wars following Caesar \u2019s death. In 42 BC he commanded the fleet of Octavian against Sextus Pompeius, who had taken control of Sicily and was harassing the coasts of Italy. However, Salvidienus was defeated in a naval battle fought off Rhegium, largely because of the inexperience of his crews. On Octavian's return from Greece after the Battle of Philippi, Salvidienus was sent to Spain with six legions, but he hastily retreated to Italy to oppose Lucius Antonius and Fulvia( Antony's wife), who had taken up arms against Octavian, starting the so- called Perusian War. Salvidienus captured and destroyed the city of Sentinum and then, with Agrippa, surrounded Lucius Antonius's forces in Perusia. The other Antonian generals, who had no clear orders from Antony, remained out of the struggle, and Lucius Antonius was forced to surrender after a few months' siege( winter of 40 BC). After the end of the Perusian War, Octavian sent Salvidienus to Gaul as a governor, with a large army of eleven legions. He was also designated as consul for 39 BC, although he had not reached senatorial rank. Despite all these honours, when Antony came from the East with large forces to confront Octavian, Salvidienus offered to desert to Antony with his legions. Apparently this proposal came after Antony had already made an agreement with Octavian( the Pact of Brundisium). Antony revealed to Octavian the treachery of Salvidienus, who was accused of high treason in the Senate and condemned to death in the fall of 40 BC. He was either executed or committed suicide, as reported by Appian, Livy, and Dio."}

She probably married \u00c6thelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhfl\u00e6d had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhfl\u00e6d's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means \"stronghold of Fl\u00e6de\", and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s \u00c6thelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by \u00c6thelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that \u00c6thelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. \u00c6thelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. \u00c6thelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against \u00c6thelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother \u00c6lfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was \"a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King \u00c6thelred had married his sister.\" The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey. Osthryth was probably the mother of \u00c6thelred's son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716."}

One of the sons of \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia, Oswiu became king following the death of his brother Oswald in 642. Unlike Oswald, Oswiu struggled to exert authority over Deira, the other constituent kingdom of medieval Northumbria, for much of his reign. Oswiu and his brothers were raised in exile in the Scottish kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata after their father's death at the hands of Edwin of Deira, only returning after Edwin's death in 633. Oswiu rose to the kingship when his brother Oswald was killed in battle against Penda of Mercia. The early part of his reign was defined by struggles to assert control over Deira and his contentious relationship with Penda, his overlord. In 655, Oswiu's forces killed Penda in a decisive victory at the Battle of the Winwaed, establishing Oswiu as one of the most powerful rulers in Britain. He secured control of Deira, with his son Alhfrith serving as a sub-king, and for three years, Oswiu's power extended over Mercia, earning him recognition as \"bretwalda\" over much of Great Britain. Oswiu was a devoted Christian, promoting the faith among his subjects and establishing a number of monasteries, including Gilling Abbey and Whitby Abbey. He was raised in the Celtic Christian tradition of much of the Irish world, rather than the Roman tradition practiced by the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms as well as some members of the Deiran nobility, including Oswiu's queen Eanfl\u00e6d. In 664, Oswiu presided over the Synod of Whitby, where clerics debated over the two traditions, and helped resolve tension between the parties by decreeing that Northumbria would follow the Roman style. Oswiu died in 670 and was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith. His feast is February 15 in the East and in the West."}

Born in Weimar, Duchess Anna Dorothea was the daughter of John Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Christine Elisabeth of Holstein-Sonderburg. Her father decided she should pursue an ecclesiastical career when she was still a child. From 1681 until 1684, Anna Dorothea was provost of the Quedlinburg monasteries. Upon the death of Princess-Abbess Anna Sophia II, Anna Dorothea was chosen to succeed her, though not without difficulties that required the intervention of the abbey-principality's guardian and fellow Wettin, John George III, Elector of Saxony. The Elector consented to her election on 4 September 1684 and Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I confirmed it on 29 January 1685. In 1698, Frederick Augustus I, who had succeeded to the Electorate of Saxony in 1694 and had been elected King of Poland in 1697, found himself in need of money as the election had cost him a fortune. The King of Poland therefore decided to sell his rights of guardianship of the abbey-principality to Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. The change was not welcomed by the citizens of Quedlinburg nor by the Princess-Abbess, as it led to diminishing of her power and loss of many of the abbey-principality's possessions. The Princess-Abbess protested against the sale and refused to recognise the Elector of Brandenburg as the abbey-principality's new guardian until military occupation the same year forced her to do so. As many of her predecessors, she often came into conflicts with the Council of the City of Quedlinburg and her guardian. Anna Dorothea suffered poor health in 1703 and went to Carlsbad to recover, but without success. She died the next year. She is buried in Weimar."}

Domnall's existence is uncertain, and is based on attempts to reconcile eleventh century works such as the poem Duan Albanach and the Synchronisms of Flann Mainistrech with the evidence of the Irish annals. The Duan says that Domnall reigned for twenty- four years and places him between\" Aodh\", \u00c1ed Find, and the two Conalls, Conall mac Taidg and Conall mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in. Flann gives Domnall's father's name as\" Constantine\". The only person of that relatively uncommon name known is Causant\u00edn mac Fergusa, king of the Picts from 792 to 820. Since \u00c1ed Find died in 778, and his brother Fergus mac Echdach was king of D\u00e1l Riata at his death in 781, it is thought unlikely that Caustant\u00edn's son could have been king as early as 781. Additionally, a king named Donncoirce is reported to have died in 792, and Conall mac Taidg died in 807, making it very difficult to accommodate a 24- year reign at this time. Since no kings of D\u00e1l Riata are known for the period from 811, when the four- year reign of Conall mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in is presumed to have ended, and the four- year reign of \u00c1ed mac Boanta who died in 839, Domnall mac Caustant\u00edn may have been king from around 811 to around 835."}

In the West Country it was particularly the forfeitures of the Lancastrian Courtenay family that benefited Stafford. In 1469 he received the Courtenay title of Earl of Devon. Stafford held the comital title for only three months. In July he was sent north to quell a rebellion instigated by the discontented Earl of Warwick. Even though he escaped the disastrous Battle of Edgecote, he was lynched by a mob at Bridgwater on 17 August 1469. Considered an overambitious man by many, Stafford was nevertheless a capable administrator, who enjoyed the absolute confidence of the king."}

Through his mother he had royal descent from King Edward III, his great-grandfather, and from his father, he inherited, at an early age, the earldom of Stafford. By his marriage to a daughter of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, Humphrey was related to the powerful Neville family and to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with King Henry V in 1420 and following Henry V's death two years later he became a councillor for the new King, the nine-month-old Henry VI. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, vied with Cardinal Beaufort for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447. Stafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and for his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate\u2014as her dower\u2014had previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers and for some time he feuded violently with Sir Thomas Malory in the Midlands. After returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator during Jack Cade's rebellion of 1450, helping to suppress it. When the King's cousin, Richard, Duke of York, rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York's followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further and when civil war began in 1455, Stafford fought for the King in the First Battle of St Albans which began the Wars of the Roses. Both were captured by the Yorkists and Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, the latter by now headed by Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou. Partly due to a feud with a leading Yorkist\u2014Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick\u2014Stafford eventually declared for King Henry and the Duke of York was defeated in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at Northampton. Acting as the King's personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford's eldest son had died of plague two years earlier and the Buckingham dukedom descended to Stafford's five-year-old grandson, Henry, a ward of the King until he came of age in 1473."}

His birth date is debated, with various sources giving dates from 763 to 766. His epithet \"al-Rashid\" translates to \"the Orthodoxthe Justthe Upright\", or \"the Rightly-Guided\". Al-Rashid ruled from 786 to 809, during the peak of the Islamic Golden Age. He established the legendary library Bayt al-Hikma (\"House of Wisdom\") in Baghdad in present-day Iraq, and during his rule Baghdad began to flourish as a center of knowledge, culture and trade. During his rule, the family of Barmakids, which played a deciding role in establishing the Abbasid Caliphate, declined gradually. In 796, he moved his court and government to Raqqa in present-day Syria. A Frankish mission came to offer Harun friendship in 799. Harun sent various presents with the emissaries on their return to Charlemagne's court, including a clock that Charlemagne and his retinue deemed to be a conjuration because of the sounds it emanated and the tricks it displayed every time an hour ticked.

In 860, al- Mutawakkil had named his three sons heirs and seemed to favour al- Muntasir. However, this appeared to change and al- Muntasir feared his father was going to move against him. With the implicit support of the Turkish faction of the army, he ordered the assassination of al- Mutawakkil which was carried out by a Turkish soldier on December 11, 861. The Turkish party then prevailed on al- Muntasir to remove his brothers from the succession, fearing revenge for the murder of their father. In their place, he was to appoint his son as heir- apparent. On April 27, 862 both brothers, al- Mu'ayyad and al- Mu'tazz, wrote a statement of abdication. Al- Muntasir's reign lasted for half a year and ended with his death of unknown causes on 862. After the death of al- Muntasir, the Turkish chiefs assembled in a council to select his successor. They did not want to elect al- Mu'ayyad or any of the brothers; so they elected al- Musta'in, another grandson of al- Mu'tasim. In 866, al- Musta'in was deposed and al- Mu'tazz came into power. Immediately upon becoming the new Caliph, al- Mu'tazz had the former Caliph al- Musta'in executed. The Turkish soldiery, after a brawl with the\" Maghariba\" troops, now turned their support to al- Mu'ayyad. Enraged by this predicament, the jealous Caliph had his brother, al- Mu'ayyad, being next heir to the throne, imprisoned along with another brother, Abu Ahmad, who had bravely led the troops in the late struggle on his side. The Turks attempted his release, but al- Mu'tazz, the more alarmed, resolved on his death. He was smothered in a downy robe( or, as others say, frozen in a bed of ice); and the body was then exposed before the Court, as if, being without mark of violence, he had died a natural death,( a transparent subterfuge). This period saw the rise of a legend that an Abbasid prince had converted to Christianity under the influence of Theodore of Edessa, taken the name\" John\" and been killed for his apostasy; Alexander Vasiliev speculates that Muayyad, who was killed in 866 by his brother Mu`tazz, may have been the convert. However, there is no Christian or Muslim record remotely associating Muayyad with Christianity or even, indeed, religious speculation. The motives for his murder seem to have been purely political; had he indeed converted, it would have given Mutazz an excuse to murder him for apostasy and been recorded."}

A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence through his formation of a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers (\"ghilm\u0101n\"). This proved useful to his half-brother, Caliph al-Ma'mun, who employed al-Mu'tasim and his Turkish guard to counterbalance other powerful interest groups in the state, as well as employing them in campaigns against rebels and the Byzantine Empire. When al-Ma'mun died unexpectedly on campaign in August 833, al-Mu'tasim was thus well placed to succeed him, overriding the claims of al-Ma'mun's son al-Abbas. Al-Mu'tasim continued many of his brother's policies, such as the partnership with the Tahirids, who ruled Khurasan and Baghdad on behalf of the Abbasids. With the support of the powerful chief \"q\u0101d\u012b\", Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, he continued to implement the rationalist Islamic doctrine of Mu'tazilism and the persecution of its opponents through the inquisition (\"mi\u1e25na\"). Although not personally interested in literary pursuits, al-Mu'tasim also nurtured the scientific renaissance begun under al-Ma'mun. In other ways, his reign marks a departure and a watershed moment in Islamic history, with the creation of a new regime centred on the military, and particularly his Turkish guard. In 836, a new capital was established at Samarra to symbolize this new regime and remove it from the restive populace of Baghdad. The power of the caliphal government was increased by centralizing measures that reduced the power of provincial governors in favour of a small group of senior civil and military officials in Samarra, and the fiscal apparatus of the state was more and more dedicated to the maintenance of the professional army, which was dominated by Turks. The Arab and Iranian elites that had played a major role in the early period of the Abbasid state were increasingly marginalized, and an abortive conspiracy against al-Mu'tasim in favour of al-Abbas in 838 resulted in a widespread purge of their ranks. This strengthened the position of the Turks and their principal leaders, Ashinas, Wasif, Itakh, and Bugha. Another prominent member of al-Mu'tasim's inner circle, the prince of Ushrusana, al-Afshin, fell afoul of his enemies at court and was overthrown and killed in 840/1. The rise of the Turks would eventually result in the troubles of the \"Anarchy at Samarra\" and lead to the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the \"ghul\u0101m\"-based system inaugurated by al-Mu'tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world. Al-Mu'tasim's reign was marked by continuous warfare. The two major internal campaigns of the reign were against the long-running Khurramite uprising of Babak Khorramdin in Adharbayjan, which was suppressed by al-Afshin in 835\u2013837, and against Mazyar, the autonomous ruler of Tabaristan, who had clashed with the Tahirids and risen up in revolt. While his generals led the fight against internal rebellions, al-Mu'tasim himself led the sole major external campaign of the period, in 838 against the Byzantine Empire. His armies defeated Emperor Theophilos and sacked the city of Amorium. The Amorium campaign was widely celebrated, and became a cornerstone of caliphal propaganda, cementing al-Mu'tasim's reputation as a warrior-caliph."}

He rose to become one of the senior commanders in al- Mu'tasim's\" Turkish\" guard, and participated in several expeditions such as the Sack of Amorium. Under al- Mu'tasim, he served as\" sahib al- shurta\" at Samarra, and became commander of the Caliph's personal guard. By the time of the accession of al- Wathiq in 842, he was, along with the Turk Ashinas, the\" mainstay of the caliphate\". Al- Wathiq named him governor of the Yemen in 843/ 4. After the death of Ashinas, in 844/ 5, he was named governor of Egypt, but he appointed Harthamah ibn al- Nadr al- Jabali there in his stead. Ya'qubi further reports that under al- Wathiq, he was appointed to the governorships of Khurasan, al- Sind, and the sub-provinces of the Tigris River. When al- Wathiq died unexpectedly in August 847, Itakh was one of the leading officials, along with the vizier Muhammad ibn al- Zayyat, the chief\" q\u0101d\u012b\", Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, his fellow Turkish general Wasif al- Turki, who assembled to determine his successor. Ibn al- Zayyat initially proposed al- Wathiq's son Muhammad( the future al- Muhtadi), but due to his youth he was passed over, and instead the council chose another of al- Mu'tasim's sons, the 26- year- old Ja'far, who became the caliph al- Mutawakkil. Unbeknownst to them, the new Caliph was resolved to destroy the coterie of his father's officials that controlled the state. Al- Mutawakkil's first target was the vizier Ibn al- Zayyat, against whom he harboured a deep grudge over the way he had disrespected him in the past. Thus, on 22 September 847, he sent Itakh to summon Ibn al- Zayyat as if for an audience. Instead, the vizier was brought to Itakh's residence, where he was placed under house arrest. His possessions were confiscated, and he was tortured to death. This was the apogee of Itakh's career: he combined the positions of chamberlain(\" \u1e25\u0101jib\"), head of the Caliph's personal guard, intendant of the palace, and head of the\" bar\u012bd\", the public post, which doubled as the government's intelligence network. In 848, however, he was persuaded to go to the pilgrimage, and laid down his powers, only to be arrested on his return. His possessions were confiscated \u2014 reportedly, in his house alone the Caliph's agents found one million gold dinars. He died of thirst in prison in 849."}

He became the pretender to the former thrones, Head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1922, upon the death of his father. He resigned as Sovereign of the Golden Fleece in 2000 and as head of the Imperial House in 2007. The eldest son of Charles I and IV, the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, and his wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, Otto was born as third in line to the thrones, as Archduke Otto of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary, Bohemia, and Croatia. With his father's accession to the thrones in 1916, he was likely to become emperor and king. As his father never abdicated, Otto was considered by himself, his family and Austro-Hungarian legitimists to be the rightful emperor-king from 1922. Otto was active on the Austrian and European political stage from the 1930s, both by promoting the cause of Habsburg restoration and as an early proponent of European integration\u2014being thoroughly disgusted with nationalism\u2014and a fierce opponent of Nazism and communism. He has been described as one of the leaders of the Austrian Resistance. After the 1938 \"Anschluss\", where monarchists were severely persecuted in Austria and sentenced to death by the Nazis, Otto fled Europe to the United States. Otto von Habsburg was Vice President (1957\u20131973) and President (1973\u20132004) of the International Paneuropean Union, and served as a Member of the European Parliament for the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) from 1979 to 1999. As a newly elected Member of the European Parliament in 1979, Otto had an empty chair set up for the countries on the other side of the Iron Curtain in the European Parliament, and took a strong interest in the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Otto von Habsburg played a notable role in the revolutions of 1989, as a co-initiator of the Pan-European Picnic. Later he was a strong supporter of the EU membership of central and eastern European countries. A noted intellectual, he published several books on historical and political affairs. Otto has been described as one of the \"architects of the European idea and of European integration\" together with Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, and Alcide De Gasperi. Otto was exiled in 1919 and grew up mostly in Spain. His devout Catholic mother raised him according to the old curriculum of Austria-Hungary, preparing him to become a Catholic monarch. During his life in exile, he lived in Switzerland, Madeira, Spain, Belgium, France, the United States, and from 1954 until his death, finally in Bavaria (Germany), in the residence \"Villa Austria\". At the time of his death, he was a citizen of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Croatia ,having earlier been stateless \"de jure\" and \"de facto\", and possessed passports of Monaco, the Order of Malta, and Spain. His funeral took place at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna on 16 July 2011; he was entombed in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna and his heart buried in Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary."}

The serial stars Buster Crabbe, Carol Hughes, Charles B. Middleton, Frank Shannon, and Roland Drew. It was written by George H. Plympton, Basil Dickey, and Barry Shipman and was adapted from Alex Raymond's syndicated newspaper comic strip of the same name from King Features Syndicate. Shown theatrically in 12 separate weekly \"chapters\", it was the last of the three Universal Flash Gordon serials made between 1936 and 1940. During the 1950s, all three Flash Gordon serials were syndicated to television by Motion Pictures for Television, along with many of Universal's other serial output. To avoid confusion with the imported Flash Gordon TV series airing around the same time, they were retitled \"Space SoldiersSpace Soldiers' Trip to Mars\", and \"Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe\". In 1966 \"Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe\" was edited down by King Features Syndicate into two feature-length films for television syndication: \"Purple Death from Outer Space\" and \"Perils from the Planet Mongo\". In the early 1970s, a third feature version was re-edited for the 16 mm home movie market, using story material taken from the entire serial. It bore the title \"Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe\" and later appeared on television during the 1980s. Afterward, all three edited feature-length versions became available through various public-domain video sellers, first on VHS videotape and later on DVD. In the mid-1970s all three complete Universal Flash Gordon serials were shown chapter-by-chapter by PBS stations across the U.S., bringing them to a new generation of science fiction fans, two years before  and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". From the late 1980s onward, all three serials became available on the home video market under their original theatrical release titles, chapters, and running times."}

It is thought that John Entwistle wrote the song but gave the credit to Moon, as all members of The Who were supposed to write at least two B-sides, although Roger Daltrey only wrote one, \"Here for More\", the B-side for \"The Seeker\" in 1970."}

He was noted for his unique style and his eccentric, often self-destructive behaviour. Moon grew up in Alperton, a suburb of Wembley, in Middlesex, and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they recorded their first single. Moon remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised tom-toms, cymbal crashes, and drum fills. Throughout Moon's tenure with the Who his drum kit steadily grew in size, and along with Ginger Baker, Moon has been credited as one of the earliest rock drummers to regularly employ double bass drums in his setup. He occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation and remained a member of the band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with cherry bombs or dynamite, and by destroying television sets. Moon enjoyed touring and socialising, and became bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in Flint, Michigan, has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups. Moon suffered a number of setbacks during the 1970s, most notably the accidental death of chauffeur Neil Boland and the breakdown of his marriage. He became addicted to alcohol, particularly brandy and champagne, and acquired a reputation for decadence and dark humour; his nickname was \"Moon the Loon.\" After moving to Los Angeles with personal assistant Peter \"Dougal\" Butler during the mid-1970s, Moon recorded his only solo album, the poorly received \"Two Sides of the Moon\". While touring with the Who, on several occasions he passed out on stage and was hospitalised. By their final tour with him in 1976, and particularly during production of \" The Kids Are Alright\" and \"Who Are You\", the drummer's deterioration was evident. Moon moved back to London in 1978, dying in September of that year from an overdose of Heminevrin, a drug intended to treat or prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Moon's drumming continues to be praised by critics and musicians. He was posthumously inducted into the \"Modern Drummer\" Hall of Fame in 1982, becoming only the second rock drummer to be chosen, and in 2011, Moon was voted the second-greatest drummer in history by a \"Rolling Stone\" readers' poll."}

Ch\u00e1vez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012. Born into a middle class family in Sabaneta, Barinas, Ch\u00e1vez became a career military officer and, after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact, founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200) in the early 1980s. Ch\u00e1vez led the MBR-200 in an unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat against the Democratic Action government of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez in 1992, for which he was imprisoned. Pardoned from prison after two years, he founded a political party known as the Fifth Republic Movement and was elected president of Venezuela in 1998 with 56.2% of the vote. He was re-elected in 2000 with 59.8% of the vote and again in 2006 with 62.8% of the vote. After winning his fourth term as president in the October 2012 presidential election with a decrease to 55.1% of the vote, he was to be sworn in on 10 January 2013. However, the inauguration was postponed due to his cancer treatment, and he died in Caracas on 5 March 2013 at the age of 58. Following the adoption of a new constitution in 1999, Ch\u00e1vez focused on enacting social reforms as part of the Bolivarian Revolution. Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s, his government nationalized key industries, created participatory democratic Communal Councils and implemented social programs known as the Bolivarian missions to expand access to food, housing, healthcare and education. The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez' presidency resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty, literacy, income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007, with a reversal beginning after around 2012; beyond falling oil prices, there are arguments that government policies did not address structural inequalities. On 2 June 2010, Ch\u00e1vez declared an \"economic war\" on Venezuela's upper classes due to shortages, arguably beginning the crisis in Venezuela. By the end of Ch\u00e1vez's presidency in the early 2010s, economic actions performed by his government during the preceding decade, such as deficit spending and price controls, proved to be unsustainable, with Venezuela's economy faltering. At the same time, poverty, inflation and shortages increased. Under Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela experienced democratic backsliding, as he suppressed the press, manipulated electoral laws, and arrested and exiled government critics. His use of enabling acts and his government's use of propaganda were controversial. Ch\u00e1vez's presidency saw significant increases in the country's murder rate and continued corruption within the police force and government. Internationally, Ch\u00e1vez aligned himself with the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments of Fidel and then Ra\u00fal Castro in Cuba, as well as the socialist governments of Evo Morales (Bolivia), Rafael Correa (Ecuador) and Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua). His presidency was seen as a part of the socialist \"pink tide\" sweeping Latin America. Ch\u00e1vez described his policies as anti-imperialist, being a prominent adversary of the United States's foreign policy as well as a vocal critic of U.S.-supported neoliberalism and \"laissez-faire\" capitalism. He described himself as a Marxist. He supported Latin American and Caribbean cooperation and was instrumental in setting up the pan-regional Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Bank of the South and the regional television network TeleSUR. Chavez's ideas, programs, and style form the basis of \"Chavismo\", a political ideology closely associated with Bolivarianism and socialism of the 21st century."}

Among his best known works are Hopetoun House near Edinburgh, and Duff House in Banff. His individual, exuberant style built on the Palladian style, but with Baroque details inspired by Vanbrugh and Continental architecture. In the 18th century, Adam was considered Scotland's \"Universal Architect\". However, since the early 20th century, architectural critics have taken a more measured view, Colin McWilliam, for instance, finding the quality of his work \"varied to an extreme degree\". As well as being an architect, Adam was involved in several industrial ventures and improvement schemes, including coal mining, salt panning, stone quarries and mills. In 1731 he began to build up his own estate in Kinross-shire, which he named Blair Adam.

They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the \"Grand Tour\", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768\u20131772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739\u20131808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771\u20135 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived \u2014 he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, \"Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam\" (in 1773\u20131778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822)."}

For much of the Napoleonic Wars he was in command of the Austrian army. Ferdinand was born at Milan. He attended the military academy in Wiener Neustadt before embarking on a military career. In 1805 in the war of the Third Coalition against France, Ferdinand was commander-in-chief of the Austrian forces with General Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich as his quartermaster general. In October his army was surrounded at Ulm. General Mack surrendered, but Ferdinand managed to escape with 2000 cavalry to Bohemia. There he took command of the Austrian troops and raised the local militia. With a total of 9,000 men he set out for Iglau to distract attention from the Coalition's movements. He succeeded in holding the Bavarian division of Prince Karl Philipp von Wrede in Iglau thereby and preventing it from joining the Battle of Austerlitz. In 1809 in the war of the Fifth Coalition against France, Ferdinand commanded an Austrian army of 36,000 men. In April he invaded the Duchy of Warsaw hoping to encourage a local uprising against Napoleon (see Polish\u2013Austrian War). But the Poles rallied to Prince J\u00f3zef Antoni Poniatowski.

He was born as David to Prince Archil of Imereti, brother of King Solomon I of Imereti, by his wife Helene, daughter of King Heraclius II of Georgia. Solomon I, who died in 1784 without a male heir, named his nephew David as his successor. However, Solomon's cousin David II prevented him, and another rival prince, from being crowned as king and occupied the throne, leading to a civil war. Heraclius II interfered on behalf of his grandson and sent in an army, defeating David II at the Battle of Matkhoji on June 11, 1789. David, son of Archil, was crowned as King of Imereti under the name of Solomon II, but David II continued his efforts to resume the throne until his final defeat in 1792. He ruled under the protection of his maternal grandfather, Heraclius II, and continued Solomon I's policy of restricting the powers of feudal aristocracy. In 1795, he and Heraclius fought with a small Imeretian force at the Battle of Krtsanisi against the Persians, only to be completely defeated by the latter. After Heraclius' death in 1798, and the annexation of the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (east of Imereti) by Russia in 1800, the situation in Imereti became precarious. His refractory vassals, princes of Mingrelia and Guria (west of Imereti), assumed the Russian protection and put forward territorial claims to the royal domains. Solomon attempted to enlist Ottoman and Persian support against the anticipated Russian encroachment. However, the Russian commander in Georgia, Prince Pavel Tsitsianov, moved his army into Imereti and forced Solomon to succumb to Russian vassalage in the convention of Elaznauri of April 25, 1804. Yet, Solomon's relations with Russia continued to be strained. On February 20, 1810, the Russian administration removed Solomon from the throne and sent in troops to take control of the kingdom. Solomon retaliated by rallying people against Russia and tried to enlist Turkey, Persia and Napoleonic France in his cause. Outnumbered and defeated, Solomon fled to the Ottoman possessions in Trebizond where he died in 1815 and was buried at the Saint Gregory of Nyssa Church. The body of Solomon II, the last reigning Georgian king, was moved from Trebizond to Gelati Monastery, Georgia, in 1990. Solomon was married to Mariam (1783\u20131841), daughter of Katsia Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, with no children."}

The latter also appointed Abd al-Aziz governor of Jund Dimashq (District of Damascus). Abd al-Aziz's mother was Umm al-Banin, a daughter of al-Walid's paternal uncle, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan. He was regarded by his father as \"the \"sayyid\", the most forceful personality, amongst his sons\". Abd al-Aziz led his first campaign against the Byzantines in Asia Minor in 709, when he captured a fortress, although his uncle Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik led the main raid of the year afterwards. In 710 he led the main Umayyad attack, although under the auspices of Maslama as commander-in-chief for the Byzantine front, and in 713 he led an attack against the frontier fortress of Gazelon. In 714/15, his father attempted to reverse the succession arrangement, by which the throne would pass to his brother Sulayman, in favour of Abd al-Aziz. In addition to various officials and poets in al-Walid's court, Abd al-Aziz gained the support of the powerful viceroy of the eastern half of the Caliphate, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who died in 714, the governor of Khurasan, Qutayba ibn Muslim, and a prominent Alid of Medina, Zayd, the son of Hasan ibn Ali. Nonetheless, he was unable to impose his will. When Sulayman in turn died in northern Syria in 717, Abd al-Aziz intended to claim the throne in Damascus, but upon learning that his maternal uncle Umar II had been chosen as caliph, he presented himself before him and acknowledged his rule. According to the account of al-Waqidi, during their encounter, Umar informed Abd al-Aziz that he would not have disputed his accession, to which Abd al-Aziz replied: \"I would not like anyone else but you to have taken over the office\". Abd al-Aziz died in Anno Hegirae 110 (728/729 CE)."}

He became the heir apparent after the death of Abd al-Malik's brother and designated successor, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, in 704. Al-Walid largely continued his father's policies of centralization and expansion, and heavily depended on al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, his father's powerful viceroy over the eastern half of the Caliphate. During his reign, Umayyad armies conquered the Maghreb, Hispania, Sind and Transoxiana, expanding the Caliphate to its largest territorial extent. War spoils from the conquests allowed al-Walid to finance public works of great magnitude, including the Great Mosque of Damascus, the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. He was the first caliph to institute programs for social welfare, aiding the poor and handicapped in Syria.

His scientific and medical works are not considered particularly enlightened by modern medical scholars (he has sometimes been compared to the doctors in the works of Moli\u00e8re). He is most well known today for his extensive correspondence: his style was light and playful (he has been compared to early 17th century philosophical libertines), and his letters are an important document for historians of medicine. Patin and his son Charles were also dealers in clandestine books, and Patin wrote occasional poetry (such as a quatrain to honor Henric Piccardt (1636-1712)). On 22 March 1648, Patin wrote a famous letter commenting on the new rage of tea drinking in Paris, calling it \"the impertinent novelty of the century\", and mentioning the new book by Dr. Philibert Morisset titled \"Ergo Thea Chinesium, Menti Confert\" (Does Chinese Tea Increase Mentality?), which praises tea as a panacea: One of our doctors, named Morisset, who is much more of a braggart than a skilful man... caused a thesis on tea to be published here. Everybody disapproved of it; there were some of our doctors who burned it, and protests were made to the dean for having approved the thesis. \"Naudaeana et Patiniana, ou, Singularitez Remarquables\", recording conversations between Patin and his great friend Gabriel Naud\u00e9, librarian of the Biblioth\u00e8que Mazarine, was edited by Jean-Aymar Piganiol de La Force and published in Paris, 1701; a revised edition with a Preface by Pierre Bayle appeared in Amsterdam, 1703."}

After a long period of Polish High Dukes and two nominal kings, he was the first to obtain the hereditary title of king, and thus to return Poland to the rank of Kingdom. A member of the Greater Poland branch of the House of Piast as the only son of Duke Przemys\u0142 I and the Silesian princess Elisabeth, he was born posthumously; for this reason he was brought up at the court of his uncle Boles\u0142aw the Pious and received his own district to rule, the Duchy of Pozna\u0144 in 1273. Six years later, after the death of his uncle, he also obtained the Duchy of Kalisz. In the first period of his government, Przemys\u0142 II was involved only in regional affairs, first in close collaboration and then competing with the Duke of Wroc\u0142aw, Henryk IV Probus. This policy caused the rebellion of the prominent Zaremba family and the temporary loss of Wielu\u0144. Working with the Archbishop of Gniezno, Jakub \u015awinka, he sought the unification of the principalities of the Piast dynasty. Unexpectedly, in 1290, under the will of Henryk IV Probus, he managed to obtain the Duchy of Krak\u00f3w and with this the title of High Duke of Poland; however, not having sufficient support from the local nobility (who supported another member of the Piast dynasty, W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high) and faced with the increasing threats of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, Przemys\u0142 II finally decided to retreat from Lesser Poland, which was then under the rule of P\u0159emyslid dynasty. In 1293, thanks to the mediation of Archbishop Jakub \u015awinka, he joined into a close alliance with the Kuyavian princes W\u0142adys\u0142aw the Elbow-high and Casimir II of \u0141\u0119czyca. This alliance was anti-Bohemian, and his goal was to recover Krak\u00f3w, then in the hands of King Wenceslaus II. After the death of Duke Mestwin II in 1294, and according to the Treaty of K\u0119pno signed in 1282, Przemys\u0142 II inherited Pomerelia. This strengthened his position and enabled his coronation as King of Poland. The ceremony was held on 26 June 1295 in Gniezno, and was performed by his ally Archbishop Jakub \u015awinka. Only nine months later, on 8 February 1296, Przemys\u0142 II was murdered during a failed kidnapping attempt made by men of the Margraves of Brandenburg, with some help from the Polish noble families of Na\u0142\u0119cz and Zaremba."}

Nabersberg was the son of a Crefeld shopkeeper. In 1923 he joined the Jugendorganisation, the forerunner of the Hitler Youth, in his home town. On 28 December 1925 he was admitted as a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party( member number 26269) and as a member of the Sturmabteilung. After school, he studied law at the University of Cologne and Humboldt University of Berlin, although he never graduated. He participated in the founding of the Cologne local NSDAP and served from 1928 to 1929 as a high- school group leader of the National Socialist German Students' League as well as a group leader of the General Student Committee at Humboldt University. From November 1931 to June 1934 was Stabsf\u00fchrer of the Hitler Youth and deputy to Reichsjugendf\u00fchrer Baldur von Schirach. In July 1933, Schirach dissolved the Reich Committee of German Youth Associations which represented 135 different youth groups. Nabersberg led a raid on the Berlin headquarters of the Committee, with a handful of Sturmabteilung men and 50 armed teenagers from the Hitler Youth. ( The figure of 50 armed teenagers comes from Baldur von Schirach's 1934 book\" Die Hitler \u2013 Jugend\" and may be exaggerated. A postwar account by Helene Gehse, one of five staff at the headquarters, reported a very small number of Hitler Youth, one of whom was armed with an old carbine.) During the raid, Hermann Maa\u00df was summoned and threatened by Nabersberg before being told to leave the building. Schirach named Nabersberg as one of the\" Pioneers of the Third Reich\" in his 1933 book. From July 1934 he became head of the Border and International Relations Office of the Hitler Youth, promoting ethnic politics amongst Germanic youth in neighbouring countries. In January 1935 he resigned this position for health reasons and assumed the duties of an Obergebietsf\u00fchrer of the Hitler Youth. In November 1937 he met Lord Baden- Powell with a view to forging closer ties between the Hitler Youth and The Scout Association. After the war, the West Berlin Denazification Tribunal fined Nabersberg \u211b\u2133 6,000. He died in 1946."}

Each direction of the compass is traditionally believed to be ruled by a mythical creature; the White Tiger is the ruler of the West. The tiger is also associated with autumn, when it comes down from the mountains into villages, and is personified by the constellation Orion, which is prominent in autumn. In Chinese astrology, the star Alpha of the Great Bear constellation gave birth to the first tiger. The tiger represents the masculine principle in nature and is king of all the animals, as shown by the four stripes on his forehead, which form the character Wang( \u738b), or King. The tiger is regarded as one of the four super- intelligent creatures, along with the dragon, phoenix and tortoise; for centuries, the four have been a major design motif in Chinese art. In southern China, on the tiger's birthday, on the second moon in the lunar calendar, fixed in the Western calendar as March 6, women worship the White Tiger. They place paper images of the tiger in their homes to keep away rats and snakes and prevent quarrels. On this date, effigies of the tiger are also put in front of temple buildings for people to make offerings. The God of Wealth, the deified Marshal Chao Gongming( Chao Kungming), is depicted riding a black tiger and holding a silver ingot. The Chinese call an able general a\" tiger general\" and a brave soldier, a\" tiger warrior\". In Chinese folk tales, tigers kill evil men and protect good men. Tiger charms are used to keep away disease and evil, and babies are given colourfully embroidered tiger shoes for protection. Tiger images frequently decorate children's clothing and tops. The\" Tiger Claw\"( hu chao) amulet is believed to ward off sudden fright and give the wearer the courage of the tiger. Because the tiger wards off disasters, it is popular as one of the nine gods worshipped at the New Year Festival. Tiger images are painted on the walls of homes and temples to keep away evil spirits. Dragon- Tiger Mountain is the name for the palace of the hereditary head of the Daoist religion, located in the Dragon Tiger Mountains of Jiangxi Province, east of the capital city of Nanchang. Zhang Daoling( Chang Tao- ling), the\" First Master of Heaven\" in the Daoist religion, is depicted riding a tiger and carrying a demon-dispelling sword as he escorts the dead to their final destination. A Daoist legend tells of two brothers who took on the role of protecting human beings by capturing demons and throwing them to tigers. As the enemies of evil spirits, especially those who torment the dead, tigers are carved on tombs and monuments. The Chinese system of feng shui( geomancy) requires that a burial site be higher on the right side, the stronger side of the body, so that the White Tiger can guard it; the Azure Dragon guards the left side, the body's weaker side. The Tiger is the third animal in the 12- year animal Zodiac. People born in the Year of the Tiger are thought to be brave, strong, stubborn and sympathetic. The tiger represents the greatest earthly power, as well as protection over human life. It chases away the so- called\" three disasters\": fire, thieves and ghosts. Ancient Chinese people believed that tigers turned white after they have lived for five centuries and that tigers could live for an entire millennium. It was also believed that that upon the death of a tiger its spirit would enter the earth and become amber, this archaic belief inspired the original Chinese term for amber which was\" Soul of the Tiger\". The tiger is historically a Chinese cultural symbol. It has inspired imagination, stories, paintings, and poetry with the tiger: the earliest tiger statue was found in the Neolithic period in China 7000 years ago; the Year of the Tiger, tiger shoes or hats; the Tiger seal, Tiger Tally and Tiger General. There are also idioms and poetic renderings such as: Tiger roaring& dragon singing- the world is peaceful; Mountain and Valley replying- the people are wealthy and the country strong. Islands in Taiwan( ROC) named for tigers include Hujing Island and Menghu Islet."}

It was adapted for the screen by writer Walter Bernstein and director Ritchie, who added a new storyline that included a satire of the self-help movement and new religions. \"Semi-Tough\" follows the story of pro football friends Billy Clyde Puckett and Marvin \"Shake\" Tiller, who have a third roommate, Barbara Jane Bookman. A romance develops with Shake until he becomes self-confident after completing a self awareness course called \"B.E.A.T.\" led by Friedrich Bismark that he insists Barbara Jane try, at which point Billy Clyde slyly makes a play to win her for himself.

John represented a compensatory attitude, which strove for a , a middle way, between the two confessions during the Protestant Reformation. Despite what others may have thought, not all Germanic princely houses were Lutheran Protestant. In fact the real influence at the court of Cleves was Erasmus. Many of his men were friends and followers of this well-educated Dutch scholar and theologian. When Duke John decided to write up a list of church regulations, Erasmus was the first person the Duke went to personally for consultation and approval. Duke John had an instinct for balance as was shown when he married his eldest daughter Sybille to John Frederick of Saxony. John Frederick would go on to later head the Schmalkaldic League. In many ways John of Cleves' court was ideal for raising a Queen.

Anger created two other versions of this film in 1966 and the late 1970s. According to him, the film takes the name\" pleasure dome\" from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's atmospheric poem\" Kubla Khan\". Anger was inspired to make the film after attending a Halloween party called\" Come as your Madness\". The film has gained cult film status. Earlier prints of the film had sequences that were meant to be projected on three different screens, an idea inspired in part by Abel Gance's Napol\u00e9on( 1927 film). The three- screen version was shown at the Brussels World's Fair. Anger subsequently re-edited the film to layer the images. The film( primarily in the second or third version) was often shown in American universities and art galleries during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The original edition soundtrack is a complete performance of\" Glagolitic Mass\" by the Czech composer Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek( 1854 \u2013 1928). In 1966, a re-edited version known as' The Sacred Mushroom Edition' was made available. In the late 1970s, a third revision was made, which was' The Sacred Mushroom Edition' re-edited to fit the Electric Light Orchestra album\" Eldorado\", omitting only\" Illusions in G Major\", a blues- rock tune that Anger felt did not fit the mood of the film. The differences in the visuals of the 1954 original and the two revisions are minor. An early version \u2014shown only once on German television in the early 1980s, and held to this day by NDR\u2014includes an additional three minutes at the beginning, including a reading of the poem\" Kubla Khan\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The film reflects Anger's deep interest in Thelema, the philosophy of Aleister Crowley and his followers, as indicated by Marjorie Cameron's role as\" The Scarlet Woman\"( an honorific Crowley bestowed on certain of his important magical partners). Crowley's concept of a ritual masquerade party where attendees dress as gods and goddesses served as a direct inspiration for the film. The film uses some footage of the Hell sequence from the 1911 Italian silent film\" L'Inferno\". Near the end, scenes from Anger's earlier film\" Puce Moment\" are interpolated into the layered images and faces."}

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V.

The film begins by describing the difficulties the civilian population posed during the Battle of Saipan including the famous mass suicide of Japanese who believed the US would torture them. As the Marianas campaign progressed though, the Marines learned to use the Intelligence Division( ID) to handle the Japanese civilians, and by the time the Marines reached Okinawa, the ID had become a routine part of the operation. The Marianas and Okinawa, pre-war Japanese possessions, had large Japanese civilian populations at the time of their occupation, whereas other islands, like Tarawa, Guam or Iwo Jima, were either uninhabited by civilians, or only by indigenous civilians. The ID used a variety of techniques to handle the Japanese civilians: they first made loudspeaker announcements in Japanese to coax them into surrendering; once a group surrendered they found a community leader or someone in a position of authority to make more loudspeaker broadcasts to encourage further surrenders. Camps are set up, and made self- sufficient as much as possible. Later, other roles of the civilians are explored, especially the use of captured documents and the need to find out who had been a collaborator with the militarist regime."}

Friend and patron of living artists and collectors, he was the son of a picture dealer and the brother-in-law of Sir Joseph Duveen. His witty and acerbic journal, kept for twenty-one years and published posthumously as \"Journal d'un collectionneur: marchand de tableaux\" (1963, revised edition 2011), with a preface by Jean Gu\u00e9henno of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, was translated and published in English as \"Diary of an Art Dealer\" (1966), and is a primary source for the history of modern art and of collecting between the World Wars. Trained in the classic traditions of connoisseurship, a great admirer of Chardin and in general the works of the French eighteenth century, Gimpel had an instinctive sympathy for the modern contemporaries among whom he moved: Georges Braque, Mary Cassatt, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and above all, his intimate friend Marie Laurencin. A friend of Marcel Proust, whom he met at Cabourg in 1907, he had a selective high regard for many museum professionals but a loathing of the experts who provided attributions and certificates of authenticity for paintings in the market. In 1902 his father, Ernest Gimpel, opened E. Gimpel & Wildenstein in New York; the firm would continue in partnership until 1919. In 1905 Ernest and Nathan Wildenstein began negotiating to buy a selection of the magnificent Paris collection of Rodolphe Kann from Kann's estate; however, the powerful firm of Duveen Bros muscled in and bought out their interest, eventually acquiring the entire collection in 1906 for 21 million francs (or over $US4 million), including what were considered in those days twelve Rembrandts. While breaking up the Kann collection and selling it on was a protracted process for the Duveens, E. Gimpel & Wildenstein (Paris and New York) benefited. Ren\u00e9 Gimpel's repeated trips to the United States from 1902 resulted in significant sales to wealthy North American collectors, some of whom he skewered in his private diaries as showing off their artworks \"like rich children showing off their toys\". In May 1919, three weeks of concentrated trading on behalf of E. Gimpel & Wildenstein resulted in sales of five paintings, including Rembrandt's \"Portrait of Titus\" to Jules Bache (now Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, as \"Man in a Red Cloak\", style of Rembrandt), a tapestry \"Saint Veronica\" to Mrs Florence Blumenthal (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a Houdon portrait bust to C. Ledyard Blair, \"Armand-Thomas Hue, Marquis de Miromesnil\", Frick Collection, New York for $730,000. During World War II Gimpel was interned by the Vichy authorities for his activities in the Resistance, released in 1942, but then re-arrested. In confinement he taught English to his fellow prisoners, in preparation, he said, for their coming liberation. He was sent to Neuengamme concentration camp, near Hamburg, Germany, where his health gave out under the strenuous conditions under which he was held."}

Gimpel was brought up in luxury in a house in the Bois de Boulogne, though he went on to be educated in both France and Britain. He made his living as a diamond broker before establishing himself as a critic of the concept of the great artist. During the Second World War Gimpel served in the French resistance, for which he was awarded the Croix de Guerre, the Resistance Medal and the Legion of Honour. In 1987 Gimpel became a founding vice-president of the Society for the History of Mediaeval Technology and Science, the British affiliate of AVISTA and the Association de Villard de Honnecourt. Gimpel believed that the basis of sustainable development in the developing world should be low-tech mediaeval machines that could be built, maintained, repaired and replaced using local craftsmen and resources.

{"question_id": "5825e5d24b9effe7e0922e701348d190", "title": "Get Carter", "context": "Get Carter is a 1971 British crime film directed by Mike Hodges and starring Michael Caine, Ian Hendry, Britt Ekland, John Osborne and Bryan Mosley. The screenplay was adapted by Hodges from Ted Lewis's 1970 novel\" Jack's Return Home\". Producer Michael Klinger optioned the book and made a deal for the ailing Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer( MGM) studio to finance and release the film, bringing in Hodges and Caine. Caine became a co-producer of the film. \" Get Carter\" was Hodges's first feature film as director, as well as being the screen debut of Alun Armstrong. MGM was reducing its European operations and the film became the last project approved before it closed its Borehamwood studios. The film is set in north- east England and was filmed in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and County Durham. The story follows a London gangster, the eponymous Jack Carter( Caine), who travels back to his home town to discover more about his brother Frank's supposedly accidental death. Suspecting foul play, he investigates and interrogates, regaining a feel for the city and its hardened- criminal element; with vengeance on his mind, the situation builds to a violent conclusion. Caine and Hodges had ambitions to produce a more gritty and realistic portrayal of violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in a British film. Caine incorporated his knowledge of real criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter. Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky drew heavily on their backgrounds in documentary film. Combined with Hodges' research into the contemporary criminal underworld of Newcastle( in particular the one- armed bandit murder) and the use of hundreds of local bystanders as extras, produced a naturalistic feel in many scenes. The shoot was incident- free and progressed speedily, despite a one- day strike by the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians. The production went from novel to finished film in eight months, with location shooting lasting 40 days. \" Get Carter\" suffered in its promotion, firstly from MGM's problems and secondly owing to the declining British film industry of the period, which relied increasingly on US investment. Initial UK critical reaction to the film was mixed, with British reviewers grudgingly appreciative of the film's technical excellence but dismayed by the complex plot, violence and amorality, in particular Carter's apparent lack of remorse at his actions. Despite this the film did good business in the UK and produced a respectable profit. US critics were generally more enthusiastic and praised the film but it was poorly promoted in the US by United Artists and languished on the drive in circuit while MGM focused its resources on producing a blaxploitation version of the same novel,\" Hit Man\". On its release\" Get Carter\" received no awards and did not seem likely to be well remembered. It was not available on home media until 1993 but always maintained a cult following. Endorsements from a new generation of directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie led to a critical reappraisal which saw it recognized as one of the best British movies. In 1999,\" Get Carter\" was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in\" Total Film\" magazine chose it as the greatest British film. \" Get Carter\" was remade in 2000 by Warner Bros. under the same title, with Sylvester Stallone starring as Jack Carter, with Caine in a supporting role. This remake was not well received by critics in the US and was not given a UK theatrical release."}

Vera was a supporter of federalism, against the idea of a centralized government. After the proclamation of the first national government junta, in 1810, Santa Fe was ruled by lieutenant governors sent from the capital Buenos Aires, which did not sit well with many local citizens and worked to increase the influence of the federalist leader Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, based on the Eastern Bank (today's Uruguay). The Supreme Directorship invaded Santa Fe in March 1815; the next month Artigas liberated it and set up Francisco Antonio Candioti as governor. Candioti was in turn ousted and replaced by the centralist Juan Francisco Tarragona. Vera and other political leaders, notably Estanislao L\u00f3pez, gathered the support of Candioti's followers, and rebelled in March 1816, helped by Artigas's troops coming via Paran\u00e1, Entre R\u00edos. Buenos Aires's occupation forces under Juan Jos\u00e9 Viamonte were defeated, and Mariano Vera was elected governor of Santa Fe. Soon afterwards, the governments of Santa Fe and Buenos Aires signed treaties by which Buenos Aires acknowledged Santa Fe as a \"free and independent\" entity until a national constitution was drawn by the upcoming Congress of Tucum\u00e1n. Santa Fe would send a deputy to the Congress, and the economically essential roads passing through Santa Fe towards Peru and Chile would not be closed to traffic. Governor Vera thus adopted a pragmatical equilibrium stance between Artigas and Buenos Aires, prioritizing the interests of the province rather than ideological concerns. Santa Fe, an agricultural region beside the Paran\u00e1 River, needed to have access to the port of Buenos Aires and at the same time could not allow Buenos Aires to centralize power, which would make its port the only one allowed to function (as it happened decades later, during the rule of Juan Manuel de Rosas). However, the government of Buenos Aires delayed the ratification of the treaties, and started a campaign to retake power in Santa Fe, first through a failed military operation in August 1816, and then giving support to Vera's political enemies and to uprisings in Santa Fe and other provinces. Vera turned decidedly to support the cause of Artigas, sending troops, guns and supplies to the Eastern Bank (modern-day Uruguay). The hostilities continued. In March 1818 Buenos Aires sent new military missions to Santa Fe and Entre R\u00edos. Governor Vera, weakened, was eventually ousted by his former ally Estanislao L\u00f3pez, who would prevail over the centralist army and rule the province for twenty years."}

He was the fifth son of Philip V of Spain, and the eldest son of Philip's second wife, Elisabeth Farnese. A proponent of enlightened absolutism, he succeeded to the Spanish throne on 10 August 1759, upon the death of his half-brother Ferdinand VI, who left no heirs. In 1731, the 15-year-old Charles became the Duke of Parma and Piacenza, as Charles I, following the death of his childless grand-uncle Antonio Farnese. In 1738 he married Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony, daughter of Augustus III of Poland and an educated, cultured woman who gave birth to 13 children, eight of whom reached adulthood. Charles and Maria Amalia resided in Naples for 19 years. As King of Spain, Charles III made far-reaching reforms such as promoting science and university research, facilitating trade and commerce, and modernising agriculture. He also tried to reduce the influence of the Church and strengthen the Spanish army and navy. His previous experience as King of Naples and Sicily proved valuable. He did not achieve complete control over Spain's finances, and was sometimes obliged to borrow to meet expenses, but most of his reforms proved to be successful and his legacy lives on to this day. Historian Stanley Payne wrote that Charles III \"was probably the most successful European ruler of his generation. He had provided firm, consistent, intelligent leadership.

He is considered one of the leading Soviet composers. Born and raised in Tbilisi, the multicultural capital of Georgia, Khachaturian moved to Moscow in 1921 following the Sovietization of the Caucasus. Without prior music training, he enrolled in the Gnessin Musical Institute, subsequently studying at the Moscow Conservatory in the class of Nikolai Myaskovsky, among others. His first major work, the Piano Concerto (1936), popularized his name within and outside the Soviet Union. It was followed by the Violin Concerto (1940) and the Cello Concerto (1946). His other significant compositions include the \"Masquerade Suite\" (1941), the Anthem of the Armenian SSR (1944), three symphonies (1935, 1943, 1947), and around 25 film scores. Khachaturian is best known for his ballet music\u2014\"Gayane\" (1942) and \"Spartacus\" (1954). His most popular piece, the \"Sabre Dance\" from \"Gayane\", has been used extensively in popular culture and has been covered by a number of musicians worldwide. His style is \"characterized by colorful harmonies, captivating rhythms, virtuosity, improvisations, and sensuous melodies\". During most of his career, Khachaturian was approved by the Soviet government and held several high posts in the Union of Soviet Composers from the late 1930s, although he joined the Communist Party only in 1943. Along with Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, he was officially denounced as a \"formalist\" and his music dubbed \"anti-people\" in 1948 but was restored later that year. After 1950 he taught at the Gnessin Institute and the Moscow Conservatory and turned to conducting. He traveled to Europe, Latin America and the United States with concerts of his own works. In 1957 Khachaturian became the Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers, a position he held until his death. Khachaturian, who created the first Armenian ballet music, symphony, concerto, and film score, is considered the most renowned Armenian composer of the 20th century. While following the established musical traditions of Russia, he broadly used Armenian and, to lesser extent, Caucasian, Eastern and Central European, and Middle Eastern peoples' folk music in his works. He is highly regarded in Armenia, where he is considered a \"national treasure\"."}

{"question_id": "47f1e2ba8bd74621d9a4fcdd303809d0", "title": "Mario Bava", "context": "Mario Bava( 31 July 1914 \u2013 27 April 1980) was an Italian cinematographer, director, special effects artist and screenwriter, frequently referred to as the\" Master of Italian Horror\" and the\" Master of the Macabre\". His low- budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, and the destructive capacity of human nature. Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy's foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as\" Hercules\"( 1958) and its sequel\" Hercules Unchained\"( 1959)( each were lampooned on\" Mystery Science Theater 3000\"). During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including\" I Vampiri\"( 1957)( the first Italian horror film of the sound era),\" The Day the Sky Exploded\"( 1958)( the first Italian science fiction film),\" Caltiki \u2013 The Immortal Monster\"( 1959) and\" The Giant of Marathon\"( 1959). Although most of Bava's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release, many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics, with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres:\" Black Sunday\"( 1960), his official directorial debut, was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle;\" The Girl Who Knew Too Much\"( 1963) is considered to be the first giallo film;\" Kill, Baby, Kill\"( 1966) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror;\" Roy Colt& Winchester Jack\"( 1970) is regarded as one of the earliest self- parodying Spaghetti Westerns;\" Four Times That Night\"( 1971) was an early Italian sex comedy; and\" A Bay of Blood\"( 1971) was a precursor to slasher films. His other notable films include\" Hercules in the Haunted World\"( 1961),\" Erik the Conqueror\"( 1961),\" Black Sabbath\"( 1963),\" The Whip and the Body\"( 1963),\" Blood and Black Lace\"( 1964),\" Planet of the Vampires\"( 1965),\" Knives of the Avenger\"( 1966),( 1968),\" Hatchet for the Honeymoon\"( 1970),\" Five Dolls for an August Moon\"( 1970),\" Baron Blood\"( 1972),\" Lisa and the Devil\"( 1974),\" Rabid Dogs\"( 1974) and\" Shock\"( 1977). Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime, Bava's shy, self- deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry, and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood. Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Federico Fellini, John Carpenter, Nicolas Winding Refn, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, Joe Dante, John Landis, Francis Ford Coppola, Roger Corman, Edgar Wright, Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino. His son and frequent assistant director, Lamberto Bava, later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right."}

It is a parody of the then- popular spy film trend( the title is a spoof of two James Bond films: the 1962 film\" Dr. No\" and the 1964 hit\" Goldfinger\"), made using actors from AIP's beach party and Edgar Allan Poe films. Despite its low production values, the film has achieved a certain cult status for the appearance of horror legend Vincent Price and AIP's Beach Party film alumni, its in- jokes and over- the- top sexuality, the claymation title sequence designed by Art Clokey, and a title song performed by The Supremes. The movie was retitled\" Dr G. and the Bikini Machine\" in England: urban legend has it that this was because there were two doctors in the country called Doctor Goldfoot, but it was more likely due to a threatened lawsuit from Eon, holder of the rights to the James Bond movies. The success of the film on its 1965 release led to a sequel, made the following year, entitled\" Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs\"."}

He was born at Arnstadt, the son of Heinrich Bach, Johann Sebastian Bach's first cousin once removed and the first cousin of J.S. Bach's father, Johann Ambrosius Bach. He was also the uncle of Maria Barbara Bach, J. S. Bach's first wife and second cousin. Johann Christoph married Maria Elisabeth Wiedemann in 1667. They had seven children, including four sons who became musicians: Johann Nicolaus (10 October 1669 \u2013 4 November 1753), Johann Christoph Jr. (29 August 1676 \u2013 1738), Johann Friedrich (1682\u20131730), and Johann Michael (1685\u2013unknown). Two of their grandsons later sailed to America and founded the Bach family there: Johann Heinrich Bach (1709\u20131789) and Johann Wilhelm Bach (1722\u20131794). He is not to be confused with Johann Sebastian Bach's son, Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach. Johann Christoph had a reputation as a composer that was only equalled by that of Johann Sebastian within the Bach family during his lifetime. He was organist at Eisenach and later a member of the court chamber orchestra there. His brother, Johann Michael Bach (Johann Sebastian Bach's father-in-law and Maria Barbara's father), was also a composer. Some of the works were later attributed to Johann Sebastian, but were recently recognized as written by Johann Christoph. One of the most famous works is the cantata , based on the \"Song of Solomon\". Despite his success as a musician, Johann Christoph experienced financial difficulties, which may have resulted in his not having been selected as the guardian of Johann Sebastian when the latter's parents died. Yet Johann Christoph found the money to have his portrait painted in oil several times, including the well-known portrait of him that is on display in a Berlin museum. Johann Christoph was heavily in debt when he died at Eisenach. He died just ten days after his wife Maria died. Sebastian Bach described him in his Genealogy (1735) as \"the profound composer\", thus hinting at his reputation, not just within the family, but within society."}

He was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl, nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, father of poet Macuilxochitzin, and brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I. During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called \"Cihuacoatl\" in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive \"Tlatoque\", until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Dur\u00e1n). Dur\u00e1n also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past. When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives. After Tlacaelel's death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands."}

He was involved in the chaos that surrounded the succession to Sultan Bayezid II (1481\u20131512). Murad's father, Ahmet, the legal heir to the Ottoman throne, had fought against \u015eehzade Selim (later Selim I); during this struggle, Ahmet received support from King (\"Shah\") Ismail I (1501\u20131524) of the neighboring Safavid Empire. When Ahmet was put to death by the victorious Selim, Prince Murad was subsequently given support by Ismail I as claimant to the throne. Ismail I wanted to use prince Murad to mobilize opposition against Selim I. In 1512, during Nur-Ali Khalifa's large-scale campaign in Anatolia, Murad joined his campaign, and even \"girded the Qizilbash crown\". According to information Selim I received from his spies (December 1512/January 1513), Ismail I allegedly wanted to conquer Anatolia, give the Rum beylerbeylik to Murad, while the rest of the territory would be ruled by the Qizilbash. Anyhow, when the Safavid support meant for Murad failed to materialize, the scheme was abandoned, and Murad migrated to the Safavid Empire where he was given asylum. He died at Kashan, or Isfahan. Ismail I's support to these rivals of Selim I formed one of the main \"casus belli\" that led to the decisive Battle of Chaldiran (1514)."}

However, James Newton Howard's score received critical acclaim. The film swept the parody Golden Raspberry Awards in 2010, with five\" wins\" including Worst Picture.

During the last years of his life, the rift between his family and that of Nicholas II widened. He died after a stroke in 1909."}

Thanu Pillai", "context": "Pattom Thanu Pillai( 15 July 188527 July 1970) was a participant in the Indian independence movement who later served as the Chief Minister of Kerala from 22 February 1960 to 25 September 1962. He was known as the' Bhishmacharya' of Kerala politics. Born in Thiruvananthapuram, A. Thanu Pillai was the son of Varadayyan and Eswari Amma. Thanu Pillai completed his studies and earned a degree in law. He had practised as a lawyer as well. But soon he got attracted towards Indian Freedom Struggle movement and abandoned his career in favour of involvement in the struggle and joined the Indian National Congress. He became the leader of Indian National Congress in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore. Pattom Thanu Pillai remained as one of the leaders of Indian National Congress during the period when Kingdom of Tranvancore became an Independent state and later merged with Cochin to form Travancore- Cochin. On 3 June 1947, United Kingdom accepted demands for a partition and announced its intention to quit India within a short period. The Maharaja of Travancore desired to declare himself independent. Supported by the then Diwan, C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, Chithira Thirunal issued a declaration of independence on 18 June 1947. As Travancore's declaration of independence was unacceptable to India, negotiations were started with the Diwan by the Government of India. Family sources indicate that C. P., himself, was not in favour of independence but only greater autonomy and that a favourable agreement had been reached between C. P. and the Indian representatives by 23 July 1947 and accession to the Indian Union could not be carried out only because it was pending approval by the Raja. Nevertheless, an assassination attempt was made on C. P. on 25 July 1947 during a concert commemorating the anniversary of Swati Thirunal. C. P. survived with multiple stab wounds and hastened the accession of Travancore state to the Indian Union soon after his recovery. After the accession of Travancore state to the Indian Union, P. G. N. Unnithan took over as the last Diwan of independent Travancore on August 20, 1947 following C. P. Ramaswami Iyer resigning as Diwan( subsequent to the attempt on Sir CP's life at the\" Swathi Thirunal Music academy\" on July 25, 1947). P. G. N. Unnithan chaired the Travancore Constitutional Reforms Committee. He relinquished office on March 24, 1948 when a people's government led by Sri Pattom Thanu Pillai as Prime Minister took over. Pattom Thanu Pilla was the first Prime Minister of Independent Travancore state. He resigned as Prime Minister of Tranvacore on 17 October 1948. He was succeeded by Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai as the second and last Prime Minister of Travancore. After India's independence in 1947, Travancore and Cochin were merged to form Travancore- Cochin on 1 July 1949. It was originally called United State of Travancore and Cochin with Trivandrum as the capital. It was renamed State of Travancore- Cochin in January 1950 and was recognised as a state. During merger of Travancore and Cochin E. Ikkanda Warrier was the Prime Minister of the state of Cochin. Warrier resigned as the last Prime Minister of the state of Cochin on 30 June 1949 helping the merger of the two states. Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai was unanimously elected the leader of the Congress Legislature Party and he assumed charge as the first Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin from 1 July 1949. First Ministry of the state of Travancore- Cochin headed by Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai resigned on 24 February 1951 following a corruption charge on the ministry. He was succeeded by C. Kesavan as the second Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin. The first assembly of the state of Travancore- Cochin was dissolved on 12 March 1952 following the resignation of C Kesavan. Following the elections to the Legislative Assembly of the held on March 27, 1952 A. J. John became the third Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin. The second assembly of Travancore- Cochin lasted till 16 March 1954. By that time Pattom Thanu Pillai left Indian National Congress and joined Praja Socialist Party( PSP). In the election for the third Legislative Assembly of Travancore- Cochin held in 1954, Praja Socialist Party won 19 seats out of the contested 38 seats. Praja Socialist Party formed a coalition government along with the Indian National Congress who had won 45 seats. Pattom Thanu Pillai became the fourth Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin with the support of Indian National Congress on 16 March 1954. He resigned on 10 February 1955 and was succeeded by Panampilly Govinda Menon as the last Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin. He remained in office till 23 March 1956. After that the state remained under President's rule till 5 April 1957. During this time state of Kerala was formed. Under State Reorganisation Act of 1956, the four southern taluks of Travancore, namely Thovalai, Agasteeswaram, Kalkulam and Vilavancode and a part of the Chencotta Taluk was merged with Madras State. On 1 November 1956 Travancore- Cochin was joined with Malabar District of Madras State, the taluk of Kasaragod and South Kanara to form the new state of Kerala. After the first ever elections to the Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957, the Communist Party of India emerged as the single largest party. E M S Namboodiripad formed the first elected government with the support of 5 independent legislators. The government was not able to complete its full 5 years term. The Communist- led government collapsed as a consequence of the movement known as the\" Vimochana Samaram\"( Liberation Struggle). The Communist government was dismissed on 31 July 1959 and President's rule was imposed in the state, under Article 356 of the constitution. Fresh Elections were held in 1960 and Pattom A. Thanu Pillai became the second Chief Minister of Kerala, as head of a PSP- Congress coalition administration. He assumed office on 22 February 1960.

He was the most prominent sculptor of Croatian modern sculpture and a leading personality of artistic life in Zagreb. He studied at the Pavle Bilini\u0107's Stone Workshop in Split and at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he was formed under the influence of the Secession. He traveled throughout Europe and studied the works of ancient and Renaissance masters, especially Michelangelo, and French sculptors A. Rodin, A. Bourdelle and A. Maillola. He was the initiator of the national-romantic group Meduli\u0107 (he advocated the creation of art of national features inspired by the heroic folk songs). During the First World War, he lived in emigration. After the war, he returned to Croatia and began a long and fruitful period of sculpture and pedagogical work. In 1942 he emigrated to Italy, in 1943 to Switzerland and in 1947 to the United States. He was a professor of sculpture at the Syracuse University and from 1955 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Most of his early works of symbolic themes were formed in the spirit of the Secession, some of which, like the Well of Life, show impressionist restless surfaces created under the influence of Rodin's naturalism, and the second, reviving national myth, become stylized monumental plastics (Kosovo cycle, 1908-1910). Before the First World War, he left pathetic epic stylization, expressing increasingly emotional states, as evidenced by the wooden reliefs of biblical themes made in a combination of Archaic, Gothic, Secessionist and Expressionist styles. During the 1920s and 1930s, the classical component prevailed in his works. In this period, he created a number of public monuments of strong plastic expression, pronounced and legible shapes (Grgur Ninski and Marko Maruli\u0107 in Split, Andrija Meduli\u0107, Andrija Ka\u010di\u0107-Mio\u0161i\u0107 and Josip Juraj Strossmayer in Zagreb, \"The Bowman\" and \"The Spearman\" in Chicago). Portraits take a special place in his opus. Me\u0161trovi\u0107 achieved works of strong plastic value in the construction-sculptural monuments and projects, mostly with central layout (the Mausoleum of the Ra\u010di\u0107 family in Cavtat, the Mausoleum of the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 family in Otavice, the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Pavilion in Zagreb, Monument to the Unknown Hero in Belgrade). He also designed a memorial church of King Zvonimir in Biskupija near Knin inspired by old Croatian churches, a representative family palace, today the Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Gallery, and reconstructed renaissance fortified mansion Crikvine-Ka\u0161tilac in Split."}

Aravindan. A mythological film, its story was adapted from C. N. Sreekantan Nair's play of the same name, which is a reworking of Valmiki's\" Ramayana\". The film interprets a story from the\" Uttara Kanda\" of the epic poem\" Ramayana\", where Rama sends his wife, Sita, to the jungle to satisfy his subjects. Sita is never actually seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a feminist perspective. It was shot in the interior tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The roles of the epic heroes are played by Rama Chenchu tribal people, who claim lineage to the mythological Rama. Director Aravindan interweaves the\" Samkhya Yoga\" philosophical concepts of\" PrakritiPurusha\" bonds throughout the film. The film was produced by K. Ravindran Nair under the banner of General Pictures. The film features an original score by classical musician Rajeev Taranath, cinematography by cinematographer- turned- director Shaji N. Karun, editing by Ramesan, and art direction by Artist Namboothiri. The film became a major critical success upon its release in 1977, although a few mainstream critics panned it.

He was commander-in-chief of the Hellenic Army during the unsuccessful Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and led the Greek forces during the successful Balkan Wars of 1912\u20131913, in which Greece expanded to include Thessaloniki, doubling in area and population. He succeeded to the throne of Greece on 18 March 1913, following his father's assassination. His disagreement with Eleftherios Venizelos over whether Greece should enter World War I led to the National Schism. Constantine forced Venizelos to resign twice, but in 1917 he left Greece, after threats by the Entente forces to bombard Athens; his second son, Alexander, became king. After Alexander's death, Venizelos' defeat in the 1920 legislative elections, and a plebiscite in favor of his return, Constantine was reinstated. He abdicated the throne for the second and last time in 1922, when Greece lost the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922, and was succeeded by his eldest son, George II. Constantine died in exile four months later, in Sicily."}

She was noted for her humanitarian efforts to save Romanian Jews during World War II, which led to her being awarded by the State of Israel with the honorific of \"Righteous Among the Nations\" in 1993. Daughter of King Constantine I of Greece and his wife, Princess Sophia of Prussia, Princess Helen spent her childhood in Greece, Great Britain and Germany. The outbreak of World War I and the overthrow of her father by the Allies in 1917 permanently marked her and also separated her from her favorite brother, the young Alexander I of Greece. Exiled in Switzerland along with most members of the royal family, Helen then spent several months caring for her father, plagued by disease and depression. In 1920, the princess met Carol, Crown Prince of Romania, who quickly asked her hand in marriage. Despite the bad reputation of the prince, Helen accepted and moved to Romania, where she soon gave birth to their only son, Prince Michael, in 1921. The situation of her family, however, continued to worry Helen, who made several trips abroad to visit her parents when they did not simply reside with her in Bucharest. In doing this, she distanced herself from her husband, whose multiple affairs ended when he fell in love with Magda Lupescu in 1924. Finally, in 1925, Prince Carol abandoned his wife and renounced the throne in order to live openly with his mistress. Distraught, Helen tried to persuade her husband to return to her but eventually she accepted the divorce in 1928. In the meanwhile, Helen was proclaimed \"Queen Mother of Romania\" in 1927, as her son Michael ascended to the throne under the regency of his uncle Prince Nicholas. However, the political situation in Romania was complicated and Carol took advantage of the increased instability to return to Bucharest in 1930 and be acclaimed as king. Soon, the new ruler forced his ex-wife into exile and only authorized her to see their son two months per year. In these circumstances, Helen moved to Villa Sparta at Fiesole, Tuscany. Always close to her family, she hosted her sisters Irene and Katherine and brother Paul, who stayed with her intermittently until the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935. The outbreak of World War II, the deposition of Carol II and the subsequent dismemberment of Greater Romania in 1940, however, brought Helen back to be with her son in Bucharest. Subject to the dictatorship of General Antonescu and vigilance of Nazi Germany, the king and his mother were cautious in their dealings with the fascist regime. They did not show their opposition to the participation of Romania in the invasion of the Soviet Union and the deportation of Jews. Finally, King Michael organized a coup against Antonescu on 23 August 1944 and Romania turned against the Axis powers; however, the country was, in the end, occupied by the Red Army. For Helen and her son, the post-war period was marked by the interference of the Soviet Union in the Romanian political life. In March 1945, the king was forced to accept a communist government headed by Petru Groza while the following year, the general elections confirmed the hegemony of the PCR in the country. Finally, Michael I was forced to abdicate on 30 December 1947 and the royal family took the path of exile. Helen then returned to the Villa Sparta, where she divided her time among her family, gardening and the study of Italian art. Increasingly concerned about her finances, Helen finally left Italy for Switzerland in 1979 and died three years later with her son at her side."}

Stewart, his older brother Henry, and younger brother Ludovic were brought up at Aubigny in France as Roman Catholics under the charge of their paternal grandmother, the old Duchess-Dowager, Katherine de Balsac. Stewart's father, the Duke of Lennox, died in 1624, and Stewart became a ward of his cousin, King Charles I of England. He inherited the Lordship of Aubigny at the age of 14 on the death of his elder brother Henry in 1632. By 1633, he was a student at the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre, part of the University of Paris, and he did homage to Louis XIII of France for the lordship of Aubigny on 5 August 1636, shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Later that year he moved to England. In 1638 he secretly married Katherine Howard, the daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and Elizabeth Home, without her father's consent, offending his guardian the king. The portrait of Stewart by Anthony van Dyck, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, may have been painted to mark his marriage; the Latin inscription can be translated \"Love is stronger than I am\" which may allude to his conflicting loyalties. His younger brothers Lords John and Bernard are shown in a still more famous double Van Dyck portrait in the National Gallery, London - the iconic image of Cavaliers. They were also both killed in the Civil War.\nGeorge Stewart and Katherine Howard had two children: He fought with the French against the Spanish in the Battle of Montju\u00efc (1641). As civil war loomed in England, Stewart joined the forces of King Charles at York where he was knighted on 18 April 1642 along with his brother Bernard. He was mortally wounded in the first pitched battle of the war at Edgehill on Sunday 23 October 1642, aged 24. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The lordship of Aubigny passed to his next brother, Ludovic, on his death. His widow remarried James Levingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh and had one further child Elizabeth. They were suspected in 1648 of plotting to rescue Charles I and on the discovery of the supposed plot fled to the Netherlands where Katherine died in 1650."}

In January 1658, Charles Stewart went into exile in France, and took up his residence in the house of his uncle, Ludovic, seigneur d'Aubigny. In the following year he fell under the displeasure of The Protectorate's Council of State, and warrants were issued for seizing his person and goods. Charles Stewart married, firstly, Elizabeth Rogers, after June 1659. He married, secondly, Margaret Banaster (widow of William Lewis) on 31 March 1662. He married, thirdly, Frances Teresa Stewart, granddaughter of Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre, in March 1667. This last marriage was famous, as Frances Stewart, known at court as \"Le Belle Stuart\" had been desired by Richmond's cousin, King Charles II, as a mistress. Charles Stewart returned to England with Charles II in 1660, and sat in the Convention Parliament, showing great animosity towards the supporters of the Commonwealth. On the death of his 10-year-old cousin Esm\u00e9 Stewart on 10 August 1660, Charles Stewart succeeded as third Duke of Richmond and sixth Duke of Lennox.

On the death of his uncle, Ludovic Stuart, he succeeded him as 12th Seigneur D'Aubigny, for which title he did homage by proxy to Louis XIV of France on 11 May 1670. In July 1667, on the death of his cousin, Mary Butler, countess of Arran, he became Baron Clifton, and on 4 May 1668 he was made lord lieutenant and vice admiral of Kent jointly with the Earl of Winchilsea.

While there he died (by drowning) in 1672, aged 33 at Elsinore, without issue, and his titles became extinct, with the exception of Baron Clifton, which passed with most of his property to his sister Katherine, Lady O'Brien. His wife, however, had had the Lennox estates granted to her for life. He was buried on 20 September 1673 at Westminster Abbey.

The years during which her sons reigned have been called \"the age of Catherine de' Medici\" as she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France. She was born in Florence to Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Duke of Urbino and Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. Catherine's marriage was arranged by her uncle Pope Clement VII. Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favors on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail 15-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her 10-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. From 1560 to 1563, she ruled France as regent for her son Charles IX, King of France. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life (he would outlive her by seven months). Catherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Calvinist Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France. Some historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters. In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the Valois monarchy on the throne at all costs, and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline. Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power. According to Mark Strage, one of her biographers, Catherine was the most powerful woman in 16th-century Europe."}

By her marriage to Henry III of Navarre (later Henry IV of France), she was queen of Navarre and then France at her husband's 1589 accession to the latter throne. She was the daughter of King Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici and the sister of kings Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III. Her marriage, which was intended to celebrate the reconciliation of Catholics and Huguenots, was tarnished by the St Bartholomew's Day massacre, and the resumption of the religious troubles which ensued. In the conflict between Henry III and the Malcontents, she took the side of Francis, Duke of Anjou, her younger brother, and this caused the king to have a deep aversion towards her. As Queen of Navarre, she also played a pacifying role in the stormy relations between her husband and the French monarchy. Shuttled back and forth between the two courts, she endeavored to lead a happy conjugal life, but her sterility and the political tensions inherent in the French Wars of Religion caused the end of her marriage. Mistreated by a brother quick to take offence and rejected by a fickle and opportunistic husband, she chose the path of opposition in 1585. She took the side of the Catholic League and was forced to live in Auvergne in an exile which lasted twenty years. In 1599, she consented to the annulment of the marriage only after the payment of a generous compensation. A well-known woman of letters and an enlightened mind as well as an extremely generous patron , she played a considerable part in the cultural life of the court, especially after her return from exile in 1605. She was a vector of Neoplatonism, which preached the supremacy of platonic love over physical love. While imprisoned, she took advantage of the time to write her \"Memoirs\". She was the first woman to have done so. She was one of the most fashionable women of her time, and influenced many of Europe's royal courts with her clothing. After her death the anecdotes and slanders circulated about her created a legend, which was consolidated around the nickname \"La Reine Margot\" invented by Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re, handed down through the centuries the myth of a nymphomaniac and incestuous woman. At the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, historians have reviewed the extensive chronicles of her life, concluding that many elements of her scandalous reputation stemmed from anti-Valois propaganda and from a fationalism capable of denigrating the participation of women in politics, created by Bourbon dynasty court historians in the 17th century."}

He competed for his native country in two Olympics, 1952 when he finished 9th and 1956 when he finished 4th, both times behind American teammate Bob Richards. Born in Santa Cruz, California, Mattos went to Pacific Grove High School in Pacific Grove, near Monterey, California. He won the Pole Vault at the 1947 CIF California State Meet. Second place in the event was Robert Culp, from Berkeley High School, who went on to become an actor, starring in the TV show\" I- Spy\" among other accomplishments. Next Mattos went to San Jose State College, where he was coached by Hall of Famer Bud Winter. He tied for second place at the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in both 1950 and in 1951. Competing for the San Francisco Olympic Club at the 1952 Olympic Trials, Mattos finished third behind Richards and Don Laz( equalling Laz' height at 4.40 m but losing on fewer misses). Those two would finish in that order at the Olympics, while Mattos only managed 4.20 and finished 9th. In 1953, competing for the U.S. Army, Mattos tied Laz to win the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. The Army notation might be in error as Mattos competed for the U.S. Air Force at the 1956 Olympic Trials. This proved to be a highly competitive trials as seven competitors all equalled the trials record at 4.48 m. At the next height, a new record, only Mattos and Richards survived but Laz, Bob Gutowski and Ron Morris all knocked the bar off with their poles( a critical rule at the time), rather than the normal failure to clear the bar. While Gutowski finished 4th, he replaced the injured Jim Graham on the Olympic team that went to the Olympics in December that year. Gutowski finished second behind Richards in the Olympics. Mattos jumped only 4.35 at the Olympics, but only Georgios Roubanis, a Greek UCLA student kept Mattos from completing an American sweep of the event. Mattos finished amongst the top 6 at the American championships for ten years in a row, 1950- 1959."}

{"question_id": "95c28caadd10df34b0c01a0fb1c99319", "title": "Johann Sebastian Bach", "context": "Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He is known for instrumental compositions such as the \"Art of Fugue\", the \"Brandenburg Concertos\", and the \"Goldberg Variations\", and for vocal music such as the \"St Matthew Passion\" and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Western art musical canon. The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach. After being orphaned at age 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph Bach, after which he continued his musical development in L\u00fcneburg. From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and K\u00f6then, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor (cantor at St. Thomas) in Leipzig. He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city, and for its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726 he published some of his keyboard music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65. Bach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He often adopted Lutheran hymns, not only in his larger vocal works, but for instance also in his four-part chorales and sacred songs. He wrote extensively for organ and for other keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for instance for violin and for harpsichord, and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of his works employ contrapuntal genres such as fugue. Throughout the 18th century Bach was mostly renowned as an organist, while his keyboard music, such as \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century saw the publication of some major Bach biographies, and by the end of that century all of his known music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through periodicals exclusively devoted to him, and publications such as the \"Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis\" (BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works) and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including the \"Air on the G String\"."}

His reign represented the height of the Mughal architecture, most notably the Taj Mahal. His relationship with his wife Mumtaz Mahal has been heavily adapted into Indian art, literature, and cinema. Shah Jahan was widely considered the most competent of Emperor Jahangir's four sons and after Jahangir's death in late 1627, when a war of succession ensued, Shah Jahan emerged victorious. He put to death all of his rivals for the throne and crowned himself emperor in January 1628 in Agra under the regnal title \"Shah Jahan\" (which was originally given to him as a princely title). Although an able military commander, Shah Jahan is perhaps best remembered for his architectural achievements. The period of his reign is widely considered the golden age of Mughal architecture. Shah Jahan commissioned many monuments, the best known of which is the Taj Mahal in Agra, which entombs his wife Mumtaz Mahal. In September 1657, Shah Jahan fell seriously ill. This set off a war of succession among his four sons in which his third son, Aurangzeb, emerged victorious. Shah Jahan recovered from his illness, but Aurangzeb put his father under house arrest in Agra Fort from July 1658 until his death in January 1666. On 31 July 1658, Aurangzeb crowned himself emperor under the title \"Alamgir\".

Set in an isolated underwater facility, the film follows a team of scientists and their research on mako sharks to help fight Alzheimer's disease. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on a rampage and flood the facility. \" Deep Blue Sea\" had a budget of$ 82 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since\" Cliffhanger\" in 1993. The film was primarily shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film\" Titanic\". Although\" Deep Blue Sea\" features some shots of real sharks, most of the sharks used in the film were either animatronic or computer generated. Trevor Rabin composed the film score; LL Cool J contributed two songs to the film:\" Deepest Bluest( Shark's Fin)\" and\" Say What\".

He succeeded his brother in 1023 with the support of the Emperor Henry II, but was opposed until Conrad II forced the rebels to submit in 1025. When the House of Bar, which ruled in Upper Lorraine, became extinct in 1033, with the death of his cousin Frederick III, Conrad made him duke of both duchies, so that he could assist in the defence of the territory against Odo II, count of Blois, Meaux, Chartres, and Troyes( the later Champagne). In the battle at Bar on 15 November 1037, Gothelo dealt a decisive blow to Odo, who was trying to create an independent state between France and Germany. Odo died in the battle. Gothelo died on 19 April 1044 and was buried in the Abbey Church of Bilzen. His son Godfrey succeeded in Upper Lorraine, but the Emperor Henry III refused to give him the duchy of Lower Lorraine as well. When Godfrey showed disagreement with the imperial decision, Henry III threatened to pass the duchy to Godfrey's incompetent brother Gothelo.

{"question_id": "1339372372702fc4688d919030841d03", "title": "David Robertson (engineer)", "context": "David Robertson (1875\u20131941) was the first Professor of Electrical Engineering at Bristol University. Robertson had wide interests and one of these was horology \u2013 he wanted to provide the foundation of what we could call \u201chorological engineering\u201d, that is, a firm science-based approach to the design of accurate mechanical clocks. He contributed a long series on the scientific foundations of precision clocks to the \"Horological Journal\" which was the main publication for the trade in the UK; he and his students undertook research on clocks and pendulums (some funded by the Society of Merchant Venturers); and he designed at least one notable clock, to keep University time and control the chiming of in the Wills Memorial Building from its inauguration on 1925, for which he also designed the chiming mechanism. Today, we get accurate time from atomic clock ensembles in observatories round the world, compared and distributed by GPS satellites and over the internet, and displayed on almost any public or personal screen. Accurate time has become ubiquitous and its maintenance a branch of information and communications technology. A century ago none of this existed, and the world depended on the pendulum clock to keep its time, referenced to astronomical observations. There was a scientific literature on the behaviour of pendulums and clocks; and a widespread craft-based industry making timepieces; but it could not be said that horology was a branch of engineering. Robertson became Professor of Electrical Engineering in Merchant Venturer\u2019s Technical College in 1902. MVTC merged with University College Bristol when the latter was granted a Royal Charter in 1909 and became the engineering faculty of the new University of Bristol \u2013 Robertson then became the first professor of the subject in the faculty. He served in this post until his death in 1941. Clock-wise, the Shortt Synchronome Free Pendulum clock entered service at the Royal Observatory in 1923 and kept Greenwich, and therefore the nation\u2019s, time until supplanted by quartz clocks in the 1940s. Throughout Robertson\u2019s career therefore, pendulum time was paramount. Suppliers such as the Synchronome Company or Gents of Leicester could by 1925 have supplied perfectly satisfactory and well-proven systems to run the bell and slave clocks throughout the building. The fact that the University chose to commission a unique and original design is a tribute perhaps to its pride in the new building and to its distinguished Professor, who was able to put into practice the principles that he had developed. The Robertson Clock\nOriginally mounted in an interior foyer of the Wills Memorial Building, Robertson's clock is housed in an oak case 1753 x 837 x 310 mm (h/w/d), originally carried on stout oak \u201cdogs\u201d let into the masonry of an internal wall. The case was also secured to the wall through its back, but does not support any of the mechanisms, which are separately mounted through the case back into the wall using studs. The opening front door is fully glazed. In its new home in Queen\u2019s Building the original studs are re-mounted on to a large steel plate, firmly screwed to the reinforced concrete wall. At the top of the case a clock dial displays hours and minutes as kept by the pendulum. The dial is a standard Gents slave clock movement which is advanced by a pulse every 30s, counted down from seconds pulses generated by the pendulum. Additional circuits in the clock once generated other half-minute pulses that controlled 3 strings of similar slave clocks throughout the building. Right down the centre of the case is the pendulum, of the order of a metre long and with a period of 2 seconds. It is suspended from a bracket attached to a massive iron casting bolted through to the wall, which also carries the \u201cescapement\u201d mechanism to the right under the face. This drives the pendulum with a small impulse of force every second, generated by the drop of a small weight under the control of an electromagnet. Part of the mechanism includes a 60-tooth ratchet wheel advanced on every pendulum swing by a pawl driven by the electromagnet. Originally this operated a pair of contacts by two pins on its periphery to generate the half-minute pulses, but at some stage these contacts were removed. To the left of the pendulum is the regulator. This is arranged to apply a small force to the pendulum which through an ingenious linkage effectively works against gravity, slowing the pendulum down. The force comes from a torque generated by a spiral hair-spring, one end being attached to the pivot of a lever that forms part of the escapement linkage, the other to a disk that can be rotated in small steps by a solenoid-operated \u201cstepper motor\u201d. This allows the period of the pendulum to be adjusted by changing the torque, under the control of a system that compares the pendulum phase to a time standard (originally a daily pulse sent out over the telegraph network at 10.00 GMT). Behind the pendulum and near its top is a standard aneroid barometer, and below that a mercury thermometer. These would have been used when checking the clocks\u2019 rate, which depends on both atmospheric temperature and pressure. To the left of the pendulum is the Civil Time Unit (CTU). This is essentially a clock that receives a pulse every second from the pendulum and keeps track of local time, GMT or BST depending on the season, to control the pulses sent to Great George to make it chime on the hours, 0700 through 2100 except Sundays. The CTU was driven by its own electromagnet. On the right is the Greenwich Time Unit (GTU), which essentially kept GMT by counting seconds impulses but also controlled the sequencing of the synchronising system around 10.00 am GMT every day. Again, the GTU had its own electromagnet drive. Behind the wall to which the clock was mounted there was a Control Box that housed several terminal frames, some relays, and ancillary components, that were connected to contacts on the TUs by wires going through the wall. Most of this has now been lost. The clock and its circuits were power by a 24 volt lead-acid battery, possibly also housed in this room. This Control Box has also been recovered and will be installed beside the clock case to house support electronics."}

The rule of Ismail is one of the most vital in the history of Iran. Before his accession in 1501, Iran, since its conquest by the Arabs eight- and- a- half centuries before, had not existed as a unified country under native Iranian rule, but had been controlled by a series of Arab caliphs, Turkic sultans, and Mongol khans. Although many Iranian dynasties rose to power amidst this whole period, it was only under the Buyids that a vast part of Iran proper came under Iranian rule( 945- 1055). The dynasty founded by Ismail I would rule for over two centuries, being one of the greatest Iranian empires and at its height being amongst the most powerful empires of its time, ruling all of present- day Iran, Azerbaijan Republic, Armenia, most of Georgia, the North Caucasus, Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, as well as parts of modern- day Syria, Turkey, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. It also reasserted the Iranian identity in large parts of Greater Iran. The legacy of the Safavid Empire was also the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy, its architectural innovations and its patronage for fine arts. One of his first actions, was the proclamation of the Twelver sect of Shia Islam to be the official religion of his newly- formed state, which had major consequences for the ensuing history of Iran. Furthermore, this drastic act also gave him a political benefit of separating the growing Safavid state from its strong Sunni neighbors \u2014 the Ottoman Empire to the west and the Uzbek confederation to the east. However, it brought into the Iranian body politic the implied inevitability of consequent conflict between the shah, the design of a\" secular\" state, and the religious leaders, who saw all secular states as unlawful and whose absolute ambition was a theocratic state. Ismail was also a prolific poet who, under the pen name Kha\u1e6d\u0101\u02be\u012b( which means\" he who made a mistake\" or\" he who was wrong\" in Persian), contributed greatly to the literary development of the Azerbaijani language.

Police claimed that they found Murray hanging in his cell at the Wee Waa Police Station around 3:30 pm, and argued that he committed suicide, although this occurred prior to the majority of Aboriginal deaths in custody which were later examined in the 1987 Royal Commission. He was 21 years old at the time. Eddie Murray's parents, Leila Jane( n\u00e9e Button) and Arthur Edward Murray remained unconvinced that their son's death was a suicide, and fought for a more extensive investigation into Murray's death. Murray's death has helped to draw attention to the issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody. Murray's case has drawn the attention of several investigations, including the Muirhead Royal Commission, the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board Report on Street offences, and his case was one of the first to be investigated by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1988. In 1997, Murray's body was exhumed and re-autopsied, revealing a previously undetected smashed sternum, and a forensic pathologist determined that the injury had most likely occurred immediately prior to his death. Despite this, the details of his death remain a mystery, and still no one has been officially implicated in his death. This has been to the dissatisfaction of Murray's family, who have called for a more extensive inquiry."}

The history of his legacy has polarized opinion, as he is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea, including his renovation of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and the expansion of the Temple Mount towards its north, the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima, the fortress at Masada, and Herodium. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE Roman\u2013Jewish historian Josephus. Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus, although a majority of Herod biographers and probably a majority of biblical scholars do not believe this event to have occurred. Despite his successes, including singlehandedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing, he has still garnered criticism from various historians. His reign polarizes opinion amongst scholars and historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, and some as a reminder of his tyrannical rule. Upon Herod's death, the Romans divided his kingdom among three of his sons and his sister\u2014Archelaus became ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea, Herod Antipas became tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea, Philip became tetrarch of territories north and east of the Jordan, and Salome I was given a toparchy including the cities of Jabneh, Ashdod, and Phasaelis."}

Cleopatra of Jerusalem was not related to the Hasmonaean Dynasty. She had married King Herod the Great in 25 BC. Herod possibly married her as a part of a political alliance. Cleopatra bore Herod two sons who were: Cleopatra\u2019s children by Herod were raised and educated in Rome.

The King of Jerusalem, Conradin, was executed in 1268 by Charles of Anjou, who had by papal authority seized Conradin's Kingdom of Sicily. At the time of his death, Maria was the only living grandchild of Queen Isabella; this allowed her to claim the throne of Jerusalem on the basis of proximity in blood to the Kings of Jerusalem. The\" Haute Cour\" of Jerusalem passed over her claim, however, and instead chose Hugh III of Cyprus- a great- grandson of Queen Isabella I- as the next ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Maria then went to Rome and proposed the sale of her rights to Charles of Anjou; with papal blessing and confirmation, these were sold to Charles in 1277. Charles then took the title\" King of Jerusalem\", and conquered Acre, holding it until 1285. Thereafter, the claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem frequently changed hands, being passed down by testament or conquest rather than by direct inheritance. Maria died, childless, in Castello de Canosa, Apulia, after 10 December 1307."}

After the succession of Ecgfrith as king of Northumbria in 670, he made \u00c6lfwine king of the sub-kingdom of Deira. \u00c6lfwine was still a boy at the time, and the title may have been intended to designate him as the heir of the childless Ecgfrith. He was, however, killed in battle against the Mercians at the Battle of the Trent in 679. Although his death could have led to an escalation of the war, further conflict was averted by the intervention of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, and King \u00c6thelred of Mercia paid a \"weregild\" to Ecgfrith in compensation for \u00c6lfwine's death. Bede writes: \u201cIn the ninth year of the reign of King Ecgfrith (in 679), a great battle was fought between him and \u00c6thelred, king of the Mercians, near the river Trent, and \u00c6lfwine, brother to King Ecgfrith, was slain, a youth about eighteen years of age, and much beloved by both provinces; for King \u00c6thelred had married his sister Osthryth. There was now reason to expect a more bloody war, and more lasting enmity between those kings and their fierce nations; but Theodore, the bishop, beloved of God, relying on the Divine aid, by his wholesome admonitions wholly extinguished the dangerous fire that was breaking out; so that the kings and their people on both sides were appeased, and no man was put to death, but only the due mulct paid to the king who was the avenger for the death of his brother; and this peace continued long after between those kings and between their kingdoms.\u201d"}

Eustace participated in the First Crusade of 1096 along with his brothers Godfrey of Bouillon (duke of Lower Lotharingia) and Baldwin of Boulogne. It is unclear whether he travelled eastward with his brother Godfrey's or Robert Curthose's army. His contingent included Hugh II of Saint-Pol and his son Engelrand, Eustace I Granarius, lord of Sidon and Caesarea, Fulk of Gu\u00eenes, and Hugh of Robecq (Rebecques), lord of Hebron. Throughout the crusade Eustace assisted Godfrey. Eustace was present at the Siege of Nicaea (May\u2013June 1097), helped rescue Bohemund of Taranto's beleaguered troops at the Battle of Dorylaeum (July 1, 1097), defeated an enemy ambush during the Siege of Antioch and was one of the commanders during the capture of Antioch on June 3, 1098. Eustace was a member of the council held at Ruj on January 4, 1099, mediating in the conflict over the control of Antioch between Bohemund of Taranto and Raymond IV of Toulouse. Early December 1098 Eustace joined Raymond's attack on Maarrat al-Nu'man and an attack on Nablus in July 1099. He gained notoriety for his actions during the Siege of Jerusalem fighting relentlessly from a siege tower along with his brother Godfrey and the warriors they commanded. They were among the first to breach Jerusalem's city walls and participated in the ensuing massacre. Finally Eustace commanded a division of the crusader army during the Battle of Ascalon. While his brothers stayed in the Holy Land, Eustace returned to administer his domains. To commemorate Eustace's crusading adventures the mint at Boulogne struck silver coins with a lion above the walls of Jerusalem stamped on the obverse. Eustace married Mary, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Eustace and Mary had one daughter: When his youngest brother king Baldwin I of Jerusalem died in 1118, the elderly Eustace was offered the throne. Eustace was at first uninterested, but was convinced to accept it; he travelled all the way to Apulia before learning that a distant relative, Baldwin of Bourcq, had been crowned in the meantime. Eustace returned to Boulogne and died about 1125. On his death the county of Boulogne was inherited by his daughter, Matilda, and her husband Stephen de Blois, count of Mortain, afterwards king of England.

Thomas III, as he was the eldest son and heir of Thomas II, felt an injustice in being surpassed by younger brothers of his father, and claimed unsuccessfully Savoy from his uncles.

After his 1972 success with \"Deep Throat\", Damiano shot the film in a converted apple-packing plant in Milanville, Pennsylvania. Along with \"Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door\", the film is associated with a time in American culture known as \"porno chic\", in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert). The film's plot was inspired by the 1944 play \"No Exit\" by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. \" The Devil in Miss Jones\" went on to spawn numerous remakes and sequels. As with many films of the Golden Age of Porn, the copyright status of \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" is unresolved.

He introduced the currency of rupee. An ethnic Pashtun, Sher Shah took control of the Mughal Empire in 1538. After his accidental death in 1545, his son Islam Shah became his successor. He first served as a private before rising to become a commander in the Mughal army under Babur and then the governor of Bihar. In 1537, when Babur's son Humayun was elsewhere on an expedition, Sher Shah overran the state of Bengal and established the Suri dynasty. A brilliant strategist, Sher Shah proved himself as a gifted administrator as well as a capable general. His reorganization of the empire laid the foundations for the later Mughal emperors, notably Akbar, son of Humayun. During his seven-year rule from 1538 to 1545, he set up a new economic and military administration, issued the first \"Rupiya\" from \"Taka\" and organized the postal system of the Indian Subcontinent. Some of his strategies and contributions were later ideolized by the Mughal emperors, most notably Akbar. Suri further developed Humayun's \"Dina-panah\" city and named it Shergarh and revived the historical city of Pataliputra, which had been in decline since the 7th century CE, as Patna. He extended the Grand Trunk Road from Chittagong in the frontiers of the province of Bengal in northeast India to Kabul in Afghanistan in the far northwest of the country.

Usually considered the last king of the House of Wessex, he ruled from 1042 to 1066. Edward was the son of \u00c6thelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy. He succeeded Cnut the Great's son \u2013 and his own half brother \u2013 Harthacnut. He restored the rule of the House of Wessex after the period of Danish rule since Cnut (better known as Canute) conquered England in 1016. When Edward died in 1066, he was succeeded by Harold Godwinson, who was defeated and killed in the same year by the Normans under William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. Edgar the \u00c6theling, who was of the House of Wessex, was proclaimed king after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, but never ruled and was deposed after about eight weeks. Historians disagree about Edward's fairly long (24-year) reign. His nickname reflects the traditional image of him as unworldly and pious. Confessor reflects his reputation as a saint who did not suffer martyrdom, as opposed to King Edward the Martyr. Some portray Edward the Confessor's reign as leading to the disintegration of royal power in England and the advance in power of the House of Godwin, due to the infighting that began after his heirless death. Biographers Frank Barlow and Peter Rex, on the other hand, portray Edward as a successful king, one who was energetic, resourceful and sometimes ruthless; they argue that the Norman conquest shortly after his death tarnished his image. However, Richard Mortimer argues that the return of the Godwins from exile in 1052 \"meant the effective end of his exercise of power\", citing Edward's reduced activity as implying \"a withdrawal from affairs\". About a century later, in 1161, Pope Alexander III canonised the king. Saint Edward was one of England's national saints until King Edward III adopted Saint George as the national patron saint in about 1350. Saint Edward's feast day is 13 October, celebrated by both the Church of England and the Catholic Church in England and Wales."}

He had a leading role in the administration of the Dominion of New England (1686\u20131689) which was overthrown in the 1689 Boston revolt. He served briefly on the council of the Province of New York where he oversaw the trial which convicted Jacob Leisler, the ringleader of Leisler's Rebellion. He then spent eight years in England in the 1690s as Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight, including one year as a Member of Parliament for Newtown (Isle of Wight). In 1702, he returned to New England after being appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and Province of New Hampshire, posts that he held until 1715. His rule of Massachusetts was characterized by hostility and tension, with political enemies opposing his attempts to gain a regular salary and regularly making complaints about his official and private actions. Most of his tenure was dominated by the French and Indian Wars, in which the two provinces were on the front lines with New France and suffered from a series of major and minor French and Indian raids. He orchestrated an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Acadian capital of Port Royal in 1707, raised provincial militia forces for its successful capture in 1710, and directed an unsuccessful expedition against Quebec in 1711. Dudley's governorship initiated a hostility in Massachusetts toward royal governance, most frequently over the issue of the salaries of crown officials. The colonial legislature routinely challenged or disputed the prerogatives of the governor, and this hostility affected most of the governors of Massachusetts up to the American Revolutionary War and the end of British rule. Dudley's rule of New Hampshire, however, was comparatively uncontroversial."}

He is the author of several well- known historical novels, including:\" Boves, el Urogallo\"( 1972),\" Los Amos del Valle\"( 1979) and\" La Luna de Fausto\"( 1983). He was the son of Francisco Herrera Guerrero and Mar\u00eda Luisa Luque Carvallo. In 1956, he married to Maria Margarita Ter\u00e1n Austria, with whom he had five children. Herrera Luque studied in the Central University of Venezuela( UCV) and later at the University of Salamanca( 1952), where he obtained his title of physician. In Madrid he specialized in psychiatry, a field on which he wrote several scientific papers. His PhD thesis served as basis for his book:\" Los Viajeros de Indias\"( 1961), about the psychopathic loads left on the Venezuelan population by the Spanish conquistadors. His interest in understanding the origins of the personalities of Latin America people took him to the study of heritage and genetics. Herrera Luque founded the department of psychiatry of the UCV, becoming full professor. He was appointed ambassador of Venezuela in Mexico in the mid-1970s. As writer and novelist, his historical work is based on accurate and documented research. His late books:\" Los Cuatro reyes de la barajaBol\u00edvar en vivo1998\" and\" El Vuelo del Alcatraz\", were published posthumously. During the final years of his life and after his death his works gained great popularity, making him one of the best- selling writers of Venezuela. His success resulted from the combination of typical Venezuelan stories with historical facts; in his works, Herrera Luque looked beyond the official history of the country and created a parallel narrative to it. Francisco Herrera Luque died in Caracas from a heart attack on 15 April 1991. In 1992 the Francisco Herrera Luque Foundation was created. In 2010 the novel\" Boves, el Urogallo\", was adapted into a film by director Luis Alberto Lamata, with the title of\" Taita Boves\"."}

He was probably still a child when his father died. He inherited the County of Roucy from his father, but the County of Reims was entrusted to Herbert \u201c le Vieux \u201d III of Osmois. Later, Eudes I, Count of Blois, and the successor to Herbert le Vieux, entrusted Giselbert with the Viscouncy of Reims. In 987, upon the death of King Louis V, Giselbert rallied without difficulty to his successor Hugh Capet, but nevertheless agreed to take an oath of allegiance in 990 to Charles of Lorraine, when the latter pressed his claims to the throne. He died on April 19 between 991 and 1000, perhaps in 997, and was buried in the abbey of Saint- Remi of Reims. No contemporary document mentions a wife or children for Giselbert. His successor was Ebles I Count of Roucy. It was long thought Ebles I was the son of Giselbert and to explain the appearance of the Ebles name in the house of Roucy, a daughter of the Duke of Aquitaine, William III \u201c Towhead \u201d, from the house of Poitiers. According to this hypothesis, and knowing the names of the brothers and sister of Ebles I, Giselbert and this princess of Aquitaine would be the parents of: But a recent study, based on onomastic data( the first names of Eudes and Lietaud are unexplained by the conventional theory) and patrimony( the lands of Rumigny and Marle, previously owned by the Counts of Blois) proposed a new theory: that Ebles I of Roucy was the son of Ebles I of Poitiers,( himself the son of William IV of Poitiers and Emma de Blois) and a daughter of, and Ermentrude of Roucy, Giselbert of Roucy \u2019s sister."}

Bergman directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television screenings, most of which he also wrote. He also directed over 170 plays. He eventually forged a creative partnership with his cinematographers Gunnar Fischer and Sven Nykvist. Among his company of actors were Harriet and Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin and Max von Sydow. Most of his films were set in Sweden, and many films from \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961) onward were filmed on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6. Philip French referred to Bergman as \"one of the greatest artists of the 20th century ... he found in literature and the performing arts a way of both recreating and questioning the human condition.\" Director Martin Scorsese commented; \"If you were alive in the 50s and the 60s and of a certain age, a teenager on your way to becoming an adult, and you wanted to make movies , I don't see how you couldn't be influenced by Bergman ... It's impossible to overestimate the effect that those films had on people.\""}

He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. During his youth, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until age 16. After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Empire (Persian Empire) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years. Following the conquest of Anatolia, Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew Persian King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Beas River. Alexander endeavoured to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and invaded India in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the Pauravas at the Battle of the Hydaspes. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in Babylon in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the Diadochi: Alexander's surviving generals and heirs. Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history."}

He was an ally of the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III and the diplomatic dealings of the kings are briefly recorded in the Amarna letters. Shuttarna's daughter Kilu-Hepa (sometimes spelled Gilukhepa) was given to Amenhotep III in marriage to seal the alliance between the two royal houses in the Pharaoh's 10th regnal year, taking with her a great dowry. During the reign of Shuttarna, the kingdom of Mitanni reached its height of power and prosperity. From Alalakh in the west, Mitanni shared its border with Egypt in northern Syria, approximately by the river Orontes. The heart of the kingdom was in the Khabur River basin where the capital Washshukanni was situated. Assyria as well as Arrapha in the east were vassal kingdoms of Mitanni. The Hittites attempted to invade the northern border lands of Mitanni, but were defeated by Shuttarna. He was succeeded by his son, Tushratta, or possibly Artashumara, under dubious circumstances."}

He was the son of Constantine I of Arborea, first ruler of Arborea of the Lacon dynasty. Married Elena de Orrubu, mother of Barison II of Arborea. The dating and chronology of his reign are obscure. Comita succeeded his father Constantine I of Arborea. The date of this succession is assumed to be 1131, when he first appears in a communication with the Republic of Genoa. In 1130, Constantine, Gonario II of Torres, and Comita I of Gallura had sworn fealty to the archbishop of Pisa. In 1133, Pope Innocent II raised Genoa to archiepiscopal status and divided the island of Sardinia between the two sees, giving the north to Genoa and the south to Pisa. In the subsequent wars of that decade, Comita was the sole ally of the Genoese. From 1133 to 1145, there is a gap in the testimony referring to Comita and it is possible that his brother Torbeno successfully usurped his throne during a war with the Giudicato of Logudoro. In 1145, Comita was back in power and was excommunicated by Baldwin, Archbishop of Pisa. The Pisan prelate, travelling the island as a papal legate, had excommunicated the judge for oppressing the people and warring against Pisa. Bernard of Clairvaux even weighed into island politics and sent a letter to Pope Eugene III to justify Baldwin's actions. Nominally Arborea was transferred to Logudoro. Comita died soon after."}

To this end, he assisted the future Alfonso IV in the conquest of 1323 \u2013 1324, when the Republic of Pisa was expelled from the island.

When Marianus V, the youngest son of Beatrice' elder sister Eleanor, died in 1407, Arborea experienced a succession crisis. The late Beatrice had a claim to the judgeship which was picked up by her grandson, son of William I. The real judge from 1407 was Leonardo Cubello, great nephew of Hugh II of Arborea. On 6 October 1408, Martin I of Sicily disembarked at Cagliari with a strong army. On 8 December, William also reached Cagliari. He was crowned\" King of Arborea, Count of Goceano, and Viscount of Bas\" at Oristano on 13 January 1409. The two forces, of Martin and of William, met at the Battle of Sanluri. The Arborean troops of William, including many Genoese crossbowmen, broke into two battles. The left battle was destroyed in a location called\" occidroxiu\"( the slaughterhouse). The right battle was broken into two part, the first was being chased to Sanluri and eventually was routed there, and the other one was forced by William to take refuge in the castle of Monreale, in the nearby village of Sardara, and continued the resistant. On 4 July, the Villa di Chiesa surrendered to Giovanni di Sena, which dealt a crippling blow to Arborea even though the Sicilian king had died on 25 July in Cagliari. William returned to France to seek aid, leaving Leonardo Cubello in charge in his absence. Leonardo successfully defended Oristano. William returned to Sardinia in Spring 1410. He reorganised his territories with his capital at Sassari. With the help of Nicol\u00f2 Doria, he recaptured Longosardo on 9 August. He tried to take Oristano and Alghero, which were defended by Peter Torrelles, who died of malaria in 1411. On 5 and 6 May 1412, he entered Alghero, but was driven off by the citizenry. With the chances of victory turned out to be grim, William reluctantly surrendered and sold Arborea to Alfonso V on 17 August 1420 for 100,000 gold florins. He was killed in 1424 in the Battle of Verneuil"}

Cl\u00e9rico is credited with reviving the popularity of the Moulin Rouge over the course of fifty years. Cl\u00e9rico was born in Paris, France, on March 18, 1929. In 1928, his father, Joseph Cl\u00e9rico, a glassmaker, had moved to Paris from the Piedmont region with his brother, Louis Cl\u00e9rico. The brothers had opened a Parisian glass shop. Joseph and Louis made much of their family's fortune during the German occupation of Paris during World War II, when there was a shortage of glassmakers in the city. The Cl\u00e9ricos were hired to make glass for cities throughout France and Germany which had suffered bombing damage. They had both acquired considerable wealth through their repairs by the end of the war. The brothers purchased the Le Lido cabaret on the Champs- \u00c9lys\u00e9es in 1946. In 1955, Joseph and Louis purchased the Moulin Rouge. They upgraded the kitchens and marketed the venue as a tourist destination. Still, the Moulin Rouge continued to suffer from financial distress by the early 1960s. Jacki Cl\u00e9rico took over the Moulin Rouge in 1962 from his father, Joseph. Cl\u00e9rico built a new aquarium for performances, expanded the auditorium, and introduced professional theater backdrops and scenery. His first revue,\" Frou- Frou,\" opened to sold out audiences in 1963. From that point on, Jacki Cl\u00e9rico only opened revues beginning with the letter\" F\" in keeping with a superstition that the letter brought luck beginning with\" Frou- Frou\". His other revues, included\" Frisson\"( 1965),\" Fascination\"( 1967),\" Fantastic\"( 1970),\" Festival\"( 1973),\" Follement\"( 1976),\" Fr\u00e9n\u00e9sie\"( 1979),\" Femmes, Femmes, Femmes ...\"( 1983), followed this tradition. The music of these revues was composed by Henri Betti. In 1989, Clerico opened\" Formidable\" to mark the 100th anniversary of the Moulin Rouge. Guests included Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The Moulin Rouge began to lose popularity again during the 1990s. Cl\u00e9rico continued to produce the Moulin Rouge's trademark revues, but the cabaret nearly went bankrupt in 1997. The last show that Cl\u00e9rico produced was\" F\u00e9erie\" in 1999, which featured one hundred dancers. The release of Baz Luhrmann's\" Moulin Rouge!\" in 2001, which starred Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and Jim Broadbent, revived the club's popularity. The Moulin Rouge is now marketed as a family- oriented destination. Jacki Cl\u00e9rico turned over the day- to- day operations of the Moulin Rouge to his son, Jean- Jacques Cl\u00e9rico, during his later years. He served as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Moulin Rouge until shortly before his death. Cl\u00e9rico died on January 13, 2013, at the age of 83."}

His mother was a daughter of Fujiwara no Tokihira. His elder brother from the same mother Atsutoshi died before their father's death. In 977 he became Sadaijin, and when his cousin, the regent Fujiwara no Kanemichi was in a critical medical condition, he ceded the position of Kampaku (regent) to Yoritada, instead of his rival brother Kaneie. Although Yoritada's two daughters were consorts of Emperor En'y\u016b and Emperor Kazan, they did not have any sons. Yoritada thus had only a tenable blood relationship with the Emperors. His cousin Kaneie was the grandfather of Crown Prince Yasuhito (Emperor Ichij\u014d), and he encouraged Emperor Kazan to abdicate a throne. By the accession of Emperor Ichij\u014d, Yoritada retired from his post as Kampaku, and Kaneie became Sessho (regent) for his grandson Emperor Ichij\u014d.

Cheney was born in Boston in 1866, the eldest child of Benjamin Pierce Cheney and Elizabeth Stickney (Clapp) Cheney. His father was one of the pioneer expressmen of the United States. The younger Cheney prepared for college at English High School in Boston and with a private tutor. He received his BA degree from Harvard University in 1890. Until the death of his father in 1895 Cheney aided him in the management of his interests, which included the largest portfolio of railroad securities held in the Boston area. Upon his father's death, he was elected to succeed him as a director of Wells Fargo & Company. Having extensively studied railroad operations, Cheney was elected a director of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad and took an active part in the management of the Santa Fe system. Besides his directorships with Wells Fargo and the Santa Fe system, Cheney was a director of Manchester Mills, Manchester, Massachusetts, and of numerous Boston banks and trust companies. He also served as president of the San Diego Land & Town Company, one of his father's old ventures. At one time he was a member of the Algonquin, Union, Boston Amateur Athletic and University clubs of Boston, the Metropolitan, Players and Harvard clubs of New York City, and the University Club of San Diego California. He was married at Covington, Kentucky, on February 23, 1898, to Julia Arthur (born Ida Lewis), a noted actress. She was born at Hamilton, Ontario, on May 3, 1868, the daughter of Thomas J. Lewis, a tobacco manufacturer, and Elizabeth (Arthur) Lewis. The Cheneys made their home in Boston, with a summer estate on Calf Island. The couple were childless. In August 1899 Andrew Christeson was elected to succeed Cheney as a director of Wells Fargo. It is not said that Cheney had resigned, nor is any other information given in the meeting minutes. As a young man Cheney had taken part in amateur theatricals, and after his marriage he financed a number of professional productions, including a number that starred his wife at venues in Boston, New York City and elsewhere in the Northeast. She also appeared in ten silent films between 1908 and 1919. Her last screen performance was a benefit film to aid victims of World War I. Julia Arthur Cheney made her last Broadway performance in 1921, playing Lady Macbeth opposite Lionel Barrymore. The Cheneys were also patrons of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where they donated a number of antiquities. Cheney later suffered heavy financial reverses, and during the last years of his life he was no longer active in business. He died of thirst in the desert near Kingman, Arizona, on June 5, 1942 - ironically, alongside the tracks of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad.

He is widely regarded as the greatest monarch of the dynasty, and by the end of his reign was the most powerful ruler in the Middle East. The son of Rukn al-Dawla, Fanna Khusraw was given the title of Adud al-Dawla by the Abbasid caliph in 948 when he was made emir of Fars after the death of his childless uncle Imad al-Dawla, after which Rukn al-Dawla became the senior emir of the Buyids. In 974 Adud al-Dawla was sent by his father to save his cousin Izz al-Dawla from a rebellion. After defeating the rebel forces, he claimed the emirate of Iraq for himself, and forced his cousin to abdicate. His father, however, became angered by this decision and restored Izz al-Dawla. After the death of Adud al-Dawla's father, his cousin rebelled against him, but was defeated. Adud al-Dawla became afterwards the sole ruler of the Buyid dynasty and assumed the ancient Iranian title of Shahanshah (\"King of Kings\"). When Adud al-Dawla became emir of Iraq, the capital city, Baghdad, was suffering from violence and instability owing to sectarian conflict. In order to bring peace and stability to the city, he ordered the banning of public demonstrations and polemics. At the same time, he patronized a number of Shia scholars such as al-Mufid, and sponsored the renovation of a number of important Shia shrines. In addition, 'Adud al-Dawla is credited with sponsoring and patronizing other scientific projects during his time. An observatory was built by his orders in Isfahan where Azophi worked. Al-Muqaddasi also reports that he ordered the construction of a great dam between Shiraz and Estakhr in 960. The dam irrigated some 300 villages in Fars province and became known as \"Band-e Amir\" (Dam of the emir). Among his other major constructions was the digging of the Haffar channel, that joined the Karun river to the Shatt al-Arab river (the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates).

He played for Brayton School from 1924 to 1927, once taking five wickets in five balls, and represented Selby Schools in the Yorkshire Shield. He played for Brayton village side from 1928, along with Cawood and Selby Londesborough, before joining Hull Cricket Club where, from 1938 to 1959, he scored 8,384 runs at 29.30, and took 872 wickets at 12.91. In 1946, he was appointed groundsman/ professional at Hull C.C., and took a similar post at Headingley in 1964. He was stated to have scored 30,000 runs, and taken 3,000 wickets during a long successful career which was interrupted by World War II, during which he was a glider pilot. Early on 19 August 1975, Cawthray discovered that campaigners calling for the release from prison of George Davis, had dug holes in the pitch and poured oil over one end of the wicket. This led to the match between England and Australia being abandoned. The match was declared a draw, denying England of the chance to win back the Ashes. He retired as groundsman at Headingley in 1978, aged 65, and died in January 2001, at the age of 87."}

She gained prominence during the disco era of the late 1970s and became known as the \"Queen of Disco\", while her music gained a global following. While influenced by the counterculture of the 1960s, Summer became the lead singer of a psychedelic rock band named Crow and moved to New York City. Joining a touring version of the musical \"Hair\", she left New York and spent several years living, acting and singing in Europe, where she met music producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte in Munich, where they recorded influential disco hits such as \"Love to Love You Baby\" and \"I Feel Love\", marking her breakthrough into an international career. Summer returned to the United States in 1975, and other hits such as \"Last DanceMacArthur ParkHeaven KnowsHot StuffBad GirlsDim All the LightsNo More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\" (duet with Barbra Streisand) and \"On the Radio\" followed. Summer earned a total of 42 hit singles on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in her lifetime, with 14 of those reaching the top-ten. She claimed a top 40 hit every year between 1975 and 1984, and from her first top-ten hit in 1976, to the end of 1982, she had 12 top-ten hits (10 were top-five hits), more than any other act during that time period. She returned to the Hot 100's top-five in 1983, and claimed her final top-ten hit in 1989 with \"This Time I Know It's for Real\". She was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart and charted four number-one singles in the US within a 12-month period. She also charted two number-one singles on the R&B Singles chart in the US and a number-one single in the United Kingdom. Her most recent Hot 100 hit came in 1999 with \"I Will Go with You (Con Te Partiro)\". While her fortunes on the Hot 100 waned through those decades, Summer remained a force on the \"Billboard\" Dance Club Songs chart over her entire career. Summer died on May 17, 2012, from lung cancer, at her home in Naples, Florida. She reportedly sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She won five Grammy Awards. In her obituary in \"The Times\", she was described as the \"undisputed queen of the Seventies disco boom\" who reached the status of \"one of the world's leading female singers.\" Giorgio Moroder described Summer's work with them on the song \"I Feel Love\" as \"really the start of electronic dance\" music. In 2013, Summer was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In December 2016, \"Billboard\" ranked her at No. 6 on its list of the Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists ."}

The form of the pledge used today was largely devised by Francis Bellamy in 1892, and formally adopted by Congress as the pledge in 1942.

His goal was to convince government authorities that the LP was inherently not a violent organization, during a time when many political groups were using terroristic tactics. The pledge is required by Section 5.1 of the national bylaws and many state affiliates of the Libertarian Party also have bylaw provisions requiring it. At the 2006 Libertarian National Convention, the Libertarian Reform Caucus attempted to repeal the pledge but failed to obtain the necessary two- thirds vote.

It was officially adopted by the territory's House of Assembly on 23 June 2016. It's intended to be commonly recited by Virgin Islanders in unison at public events, especially in schools, and during public celebrations. The pledge was first publicly recited on 1 July 2016 at Territory Day celebrations by Premier Dr. D. Orlando Smith and members of the government. The pledge reads: Adoption of the pledge was a project of Myron Walwyn, the territory's Minister for Education and Culture. He explained that its adoption was part of the government's efforts\" to build a nation of citizens and residents that understand and have deep reverence for our heritage as Virgin Islanders\". In the same vein the government adopted a territorial song and an official territorial uniform. The government also erected flagpoles at each school and public schoolchildren now sing the territorial song as they raise the UK and VI flags each school day morning. The pledge has received a mixed reaction. Some questioned the need for a pledge at all. The reference to God in the pledge is a source of some element of controversy too. House of Assembly member, Alvera Maduro- Caines argued it was appropriate. She said she saw' nothing wrong with God being a part of the pledge as we are a Christian and God fearing society'. Others felt the overtly religious reference infringed their rights. The leader of the People \u2019s Empowerment Party, Natalio D. Wheatley, said there was a\" glaring problem\" with the pledge: that it is\" oxymoronic\" to refer to a territory as a country. The use of the capitalised term\" Territory\" suggests the word is part of the territory's name when it's not. Grammatically, the reference to\" these Virgin Islands\" rather than\" the Virgin Islands\" at the end of the pledge renders the pledge ungrammatical when recited outside the territory. There was little public engagement concerning the wording of the pledge before its adoption."}

The Pledge states: \"I pledge to explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job I consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which I work. \" The purpose of the Pledge is to encourage graduating students to be mindful of the social and environmental impacts of their employment as they enter the workforce or continue their education. It is up to students to define for themselves what socially and environmentally responsible means. Over one hundred Universities and colleges as well as some high schools use the pledge to some extent. There are several different types of schools involved, including the following: Students who voluntarily sign the pledge seek out employment that reflects their values, sometimes turning down jobs with which they do not feel comfortable. Others work to make changes after they are on the job. Some examples include promoting recycling at their workplace, removing discriminatory language from training materials, working for gender equality in athletics, and helping to convince employers to reject contracts that would clearly have negative impacts on society or the environment. The Pledge was first established at Humboldt State University, California, in 1987. Manchester University in Indiana hosted the effort from 1996 to 2007, at which time Bentley University near Boston became the host. The project takes shape in different ways depending on the institution. At some colleges, for example, students sign wallet-sized cards with the Pledge written on them that they can keep as a reminder of the commitment they've made. Some institutions put the Pledge into the formal program for their Commencement ceremonies. At other institutions, pledge signers wear green ribbons or green tassels at Commencement to signify their commitment (some schools use a different color of ribbon). At Bentley University the pledge is a \"capstone\" of its four-year Civic Leadership Program and at Humboldt State University, the student government funds a student Pledge coordinator internship. The Pledge serves to promote social and environmental responsibility on three different levels: Students and alumni who are making choices about employment; schools including values and citizenship in their curriculum as opposed to just knowledge and skills; and the workplaces and wider society being concerned about issues beyond just the bottom line. The Graduation Pledge Alliance maintains a web site for campus organizers and those who have signed the Pledge."}

It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad as two rival fathers, workaholic Howard Langston( Schwarzenegger) and stressed out postal worker Myron Larabee( Sinbad), both desperately trying to purchase a Turbo- Man action figure for their respective sons on a last- minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve. Inspired by real- life Christmas toy sell- outs for such items as Cabbage Patch Kids, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project was picked up by 20th Century Fox. Delays to Fox's reboot of\" Planet of the Apes\" allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. \" Jingle All the Way\" was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo- Man action figure used in the film.

His guitar work was primarily rooted in funk and hard rock, although he often experimented with other genres including reggae and speed metal. He is considered to have been a major influence on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. Born in Haifa, Israel, Slovak immigrated with his family to the United States in 1967 when he was five years old. Slovak met future bandmates Anthony Kiedis, Flea, and Jack Irons while attending high school in Los Angeles. He joined the group Anthym along with Irons while attending Fairfax High School; Flea would later join the group, which later changed its name to What Is This ?. Slovak, Flea, Kiedis, and Irons started Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1982, which became popular in the Los Angeles area, playing various shows around the city. However, Slovak quit the band to focus on What is This?, which had been signed to a record deal, leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their debut album without him. He rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985, and recorded the albums\" Freaky Styley\" and\" The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\" with the band. During his career, Slovak developed a serious heroin addiction. He attempted to quit the drug many times, but ultimately succumbed to his addiction, dying of an overdose on June 25, 1988 at age 26. He was replaced by guitarist John Frusciante, who was greatly influenced by Slovak's playing style. Several Red Hot Chili Peppers songs have been written as tributes to Slovak, including\" OthersideKnock Me Down My Lovely ManThis Is the PlaceDosed\" and\" Feasting on the Flowers\". In 1999, his brother James Slovak published a book entitled\" Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak\", which features Slovak's diaries and paintings.

The magazine was established by Suzanne Miller who had previously edited the magazine\" FastTimes\". The magazine was co-edited by Nimalan Nades( also known by his real name Nimalan Nadesalingam) who had previously edited a local student magazine in Lincoln, England and who had also been a published as a writer for\" FastTime\".

The song was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost out to\" Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\". Alan Bergman would recall that after Michel Legrand had written eight melodies which were somehow not viable for the film, Marilyn Bergman suggested the opening line\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\", and Legrand then completed the song's melody based on that phrase. Marilyn Bergman would later comment on the double meaning of the phrase\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\" within its parent film: as the romantic theme song's title the question overtly references the marriage proposal Mary Spencer( played by Jean Simmons) received and accepted sixteen years earlier but, as Mary's present- day angst becomes apparent,\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\" is recast as a question Mary must ask herself. \" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was sung in\" The Happy Ending\" by Michael Dees whose version was included on the film's soundtrack album. The first evident\" outside\" cover was by Barbra Streisand who recorded the song on 24 September 1969 in the first session for her intended album\" The Singer\", with the track having a single release 26 October 1969. After two later sessions- in respectively March and April of 1970- Streisand had recorded a total of eight tracks toward\" The Singer\", only to have Clive Davis shelve the project in favor of an album which was soft rock rather than easy listening, with Streisand cutting the first tracks for what would be her 1971 album release\" Stoney End\" on 29 July 1970. \" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was utilized as the B-side of Streisand's# 1 hit\" The Way We Were\" released in 1973, and was included on the 1974 album release\" The Way We Were\". Although the Streisand version drew no evident attention in its original single release,\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" did reach the Easy Listening Top 40 ranking in\" Billboard\"- with a# 40 peak- via a January 1970 recording by veteran vocalist Jaye P. Morgan, whose version served as the title cut for her first album release in eight years( and her last until 1976). Also in 1970\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was recorded by Della Reese for her album\" Right Now\": the 9 November 1997 broadcast of the CBS series\" Touched by an Angel\" featured Reese's character; the angel Tess, singing the song in the guise of a supperclub singer .. \" What Are Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was also recorded by Dusty Springfield in 1970, in the July sessions at Trident Studios( Soho) for her\" See All Her Faces\" album, but despite Springfield having had a Top 40 hit with the Bergman's first Oscar- winning composition\" The Windmills of Your Mind\" her version of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was cut from her upcoming album without being mixed, remaining\" in the can\" until 1994 when Philips Records put together the four volume box set\" Dusty: The Legend Of Dusty Springfield\" with a completed recording of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" being included on the disc devoted to\" Rarities\"( the track was in fact first released earlier in the year as a bonus on a CD single which paired Springfield's hits\" Goin' Back\" and\" Son- of- a Preacher Man\"). In 2006 Springfield's version of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was featured in a 60- second commercial for diamonds- sponsored by the Diamond Trading Company- which aired on American television, in cinemas and online. In 1972 Sarah Vaughan recorded\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" for the album\" Sarah Vaughan with Michel Legrand\" on which Legrand acted as arranger and conductor. The track would win Legrand the 1972 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist. More than thirty years later, Billy Childs, Gil Goldstein, and Heitor Pereira won the 2006 Grammy Award for the same category for a version performed by trumpeteer Chris Botti and vocalist Sting on Botti's 2005 album\" To Love Again\". There is also a song called\" What Are You Doin' the Rest of Your Life?\" in the 1944 film\" Hollywood Canteen\", performed by Jack Carson and Jane Wyman with the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra."}

While a mathematics teacher at St. Mark's School of Texas, Macy was active in the Dallas bluegrass music scene of the 1980s, and was in a band called Danger in the Air. The band released two independent albums. With the Chicks she was the group's guitarist, co-lead singer, and occasional songwriter. Macy left the Dixie Chicks in late 1992 in a dispute with the Erwin sisters about the group's musical direction. Macy advocated for a\" purer\" bluegrass approach. ( She was not replaced; the foursome became a trio. It would be still several more years until the Dixie Chicks achieved their big commercial break, when Natalie Maines replaced Laura Lynch as lead singer.) Macy then joined Sara Hickman and Patty Lege to form the group Domestic Science Club, which issued two albums before disbanding. While still in Dallas, Macy played with an informal group named Round Robin, but she eventually moved to southern Kansas. Macy hosted an evening music show on local NPR affiliate, KERA in Dallas, in the mid-1990s. She then performed with Mark Bennett, Mike and Vicki Lynn Theobald in The Blue Plate Special. The band performed at the Walnut Valley Festival, in Winfield, Kansas in 1999. Big Twang was Macy's next project. The bluegrass quintet was founded by Macy and won the 1999 RockyGrass Band Championship.

The first multimedia star, Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1931 to 1954. His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dick Haymes, and Dean Martin. \"Yank\" magazine said that he was \"the person who had done the most for the morale of overseas servicemen\" during World War II. In 1948, American polls declared him the \"most admired man alive\", ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII. Also in 1948, \"Music Digest\" estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music. Crosby won an Oscar for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture \"Going My Way\" and was nominated for his reprise of the role in \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" opposite Ingrid Bergman the next year, becoming the first of six actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first Grammy Global Achievement Award. He is one of 33 people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the categories of motion pictures, radio, and audio recording. He was also known for his collaborations with longtime friend Bob Hope, starring in the \"Road to...\" films from 1940 to 1962. Crosby influenced the development of the postwar recording industry. After seeing a demonstration of a German broadcast quality reel-to-reel tape recorder brought to America by John T. Mullin, he invested $50,000 in a California electronics company called Ampex to build copies. He then convinced ABC to allow him to tape his shows. He became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. Through the medium of recording, he constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) used in motion picture production, a practice that became an industry standard. In addition to his work with early audio tape recording, he helped to finance the development of videotape, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team."}

The song had been published in 1950 and was recorded by Arthur Godfrey, The Three Suns with Texas Jim Robertson, and by the Johnny Guarnieri Quintet in 1950. None of these recordings charted. The Crosby recording came about when the singer had Armstrong as a guest on his radio show which was being taped on April 19, 1951 for broadcast on April 25 that year. As was customary, the songs to be used in the broadcast were taped in advance as a back-up in case the live broadcast versions did not go well. The song was so well received that Decca Records decided to issue the pre-recording commercially and it charted briefly in June 1951 with a peak position of #19.

He was the eldest son of Godfrey I the Prisoner, Count of Verdun, and Matilda, daughter of Herman, Duke of Saxony, of the Billung family, a widow of Baldwin III of Flanders. Frederick was among those captured along with his father in 985 when Lothair of France attacked Verdun in 985. He was released in 987 by family ally Hugh Capet, then Duke of the Franks(\" dux et princeps Francorum\"). In 988, Frederick worked to bring the body of his brother Adalberon, Bishop of Verdun, who died in Italy, to be buried in the Verdun Cathedral. It is uncertain how long Frederic remained as Count in Verdun as the charter dated 17 Aug 1156 of Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa indicates that the County of Verdun was transferred to the Bishop of Verdun during the reign of Emperor Otto III. However, a charter dated 1020, under which Haimont, Bishop of Verdun, confirmed an exchange of property, names\" domni Frederici\u2026 comes nostre civitatis\", which suggests that Frederic continued as count at least in part of the county. A 1020 charter of Abbot Richard demonstrates that Frederick must have resigned the countship soon after, as it refers to\" temporis dominus Fredericus qui comes Virdunensis civitatis fuerat\". Frederick was also Count of Castres, as shown by the charter dated 5 May 1005 under which Henry II, then King of Germany, granted market rights at\" Doncheria \u2026 in comitatu\u2026Frederici comitis\u2026Castricensis\" to the Abbey Saint- M\u00e9dard de Soissons.

The screenplay is by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas from a story by Lucas, who was also the executive producer. It is the third installment in the original\" Star Wars\" trilogy, the third film to be produced, and sixth film in the\" Skywalker saga\". It takes place one year after\" The Empire Strikes Back\". The film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew and Frank Oz. In the film, the Galactic Empire, under the direction of the ruthless Emperor, is constructing a second Death Star in order to crush the Rebel Alliance once and for all. Since the Emperor plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full- scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill the Emperor, effectively bringing an end to his hold over the galaxy. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker struggles to bring his father Darth Vader back to the light side of the Force. Steven Spielberg, David Lynch and David Cronenberg were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow Industrial Light& Magic more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to. Strict secrecy surrounded the production. The film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, six years to the day of the release of the first film, receiving mostly positive reviews. It grossed$ 475 million worldwide, becoming the highest- grossing film of 1983. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades."}

A member of the amphibious Mon Calamari species, Ackbar was the foremost military commander of the Rebel Alliance, and led the attack against the second Death Star in\" Return of the Jedi\"( 1983), the final entry in the original\" Star Wars\" trilogy. Although his role in the film was brief, Ackbar became a prominent character in other\" Star Wars\" media, including novels, comic books, video games, and television shows, and later made appearances in the sequel trilogy films( 2015) and( 2017), and the television series. With his distinctive salmon- colored skin, webbed hands, high- domed head, and large fish- like eyes, Ackbar was realized in\" Return of the Jedi\" through the use of either a half- body puppet or full- body costume, depending on the camera angle required. In all three films he was portrayed by puppeteer Timothy D. Rose, who originally played other characters, but requested to also play Ackbar after seeing his sculpt on a display stand. Ackbar was voiced by Erik Bauersfeld, who made up the voice on the spot after looking at a photograph of Ackbar. Bauersfeld voiced the character in\" Return of the Jedi\" and\" The Force Awakens\", but died before the filming of\" The Last Jedi\", in which he was replaced by Tom Kane, who had voiced Ackbar in other works of\" Star Wars\" media. Ackbar was originally planned to be more conventionally humanoid, but after\" Star Wars\" creator George Lucas decided to make him an alien, he allowed\" Return of the Jedi\" director Richard Marquand to pick from various designs. Marquand picked a sketch by concept artist Nilo Rodis- Jamero, over the objections of other members of the film crew who thought the character looked too silly or ugly. Ackbar made his first appearance not in the film, but in a\" Star Wars\" newspaper comic strip that ran a few months before\" Return of the Jedi\" was released. Lucas was not entirely pleased with the final result of the character in the film and felt it was a compromise. Ackbar's first name, Gial, was not established until April 2012. Ackbar had just 14 lines of dialogue in\" Return of the Jedi\", and his total screen time across all three film appearances totaled only three minutes and 30 seconds. Nevertheless, he is considered a fan favorite among\" Star Wars\" characters, and was ranked No. 16 in a 1998 list of the\" Top 20\" Star Wars\" Characters\" in the magazine\" Star Wars Insider\". His line\" It's a trap!\" from\" Return of the Jedi\" became one of the most famous and beloved lines from the original\" Star Wars\" trilogy, as well as a popular Internet meme. Several fans expressed disappointment with Ackbar's sudden death in\" The Last Jedi\", calling it abrupt and unceremonious, a sentiment echoed by Ackbar actors Rose and Kane, as well as the film's editor Bob Ducsay."}

He was the only son of Louis, Prince of Piacenza, and his wife Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. Born at the Royal Palace of Madrid at the court of his maternal grandfather King Charles IV of Spain, he spent his first years living at the Spanish court. In 1801, by the Treaty of Aranjuez, Charles became Crown Prince of Etruria, a newly created kingdom formed from territories of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Charles moved to Italy with his parents and in 1803, not yet four years old, he succeeded his father as King of Etruria under the name Charles Louis I. His mother Infanta Maria Luisa assumed the regency while Charles Louis' minority lasted. In 1807 Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the kingdom of Etruria and Charles Louis and his mother took refuge in Spain. In May 1808 they were forced to leave Spain by Napoleon who arrested Charles Louis' mother in a convent in Rome. Between 1811 and 1814 Charles Louis was placed under the care of his grandfather, the deposed King Charles IV of Spain. After Napoleon's fall, in 1817, Infanta Maria Luisa became Duchess of Lucca in her own right and Charles Louis, age sixteen, became hereditary Prince of Lucca. In 1820 he married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy. They were a mismatched couple and had only one surviving son. At his mother's death in 1824, Charles Louis became the reigning Duke of Lucca as Charles I. He had little interest in ruling. He left the duchy in the hands of his ministers and spent most of his time traveling around Europe. A liberal movement led him to abdicate Lucca in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in October 1847 in exchange for financial compensation, as he wanted to retire to private life. Two months later, in December 1847, at the death of the former Empress Marie Louise, he succeeded her as the reigning Duke of Parma according to what had been stipulated by the Congress of Vienna. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill- received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution. He regained control of Parma under the protection of Austrian troops, but finally abdicated in favor of his son Charles III on 14 March 1849. His son was assassinated in 1854 and his grandson Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma, was deposed in 1860. In exile Charles Louis assumed the title of count of Villafranca. He spent the last years of his life mostly in France, dying at Nice on 16 April 1883."}

Starring Parker, Stone, Kristen Miller, Masasa Moyo, Daran Norris, Phil Hendrie, Maurice LaMarche, Chelsea Marguerite, Jeremy Shada and Fred Tatasciore , the film is a satire of big-budget action films and their associated clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, with particular humorous emphasis on the global implications of the politics of the United States. The title is derived from domestic and international political criticisms that the foreign policy of the United States frequently and unilaterally tries to \"police the worldTeam America\" follows the fictional titular paramilitary police force and their recruitment of a Broadway actor in an attempt to save the world from Kim Jong-il, who is leading a conspiracy of Islamic terrorists and liberal Hollywood actors in a bid for global destruction. Instead of live actors, the film uses a style of puppetry based on Supermarionation, known for its use in the British TV series \"Thunderbirds\", although Stone and Parker were not fans of that show. The duo worked on the script with former \"South Park\" writer Brady for nearly two years. The film had a troubled time in production, with various problems regarding the marionettes, as well as the scheduling extremes of having the film come out in time. In addition, the filmmakers fought with the Motion Picture Association of America, who returned the film over nine times with an NC-17 rating due to an explicit sex scene in the film. The film was cut by less than a minute and rated R for \"graphic crude and sexual humor, violent images and strong language \u2013 all involving puppets\". The film premiered at the Denver Film Festival on October 14, 2004, and was released theatrically in the United States the following day on October 15, 2004 by Paramount Pictures. It has received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed over $51 million worldwide against its $32 million budget."}

Initially, Neni\u021bescu's poetry was discursive and religious, in line with the \"G\u00e2ndirist\" current. His verse became progressively more hermetic, as can be seen in the anthology volume \"Ani\" (1973). Including texts published in the 1940s and '50s, it reveals the intellectualized lyric verse of an eminently classical nature."}

He also audited courses at Ia\u0219i University's literature faculty. Neni\u021bescu attended an officers' school, volunteered in the Romanian War of Independence and was wounded at Grivitsa. He then studied at the philosophy faculty of Berlin University, taking a doctorate in 1887 at Leipzig University with a thesis on Baruch Spinoza. He worked as a schoolteacher and inspector in Bucharest. He traveled south of the Danube, a trip that resulted in an ample \"ethnic and statistical study of the AromaniansDe la rom\u00e2nii din Turcia European\u0103\", 1895).

Born in New York City, he emigrated to Israel with his family at the age of four, in 1971. He was a young Israeli Orthodox Jewish scholar and rabbi who was most famous for his leadership of Kahane Chai, a far-right political party that broke from his father's Kach party after Meir Kahane's assassination in 1990. He was convicted several times by Israeli courts for advocating violence against Arabs. Kahane was the author of \"The Haggada of the Jewish Idea\", a commentary based on his father's teachings of the Passover Haggadah read at the Passover Seder. He wrote a Torah portion sheet called \"Darka Shel TorahThe Way of the Torah\") that was distributed for the weekly Torah portions. He and his wife Talya were shot and killed near the Israeli settlement of Ofra on 31 December 2000. The ambush took place on road 60 about 15 KM north of Jerusalem, just before the town of Ofra. Five of the couple's six children were in the van when they were hit by automatic rifle fire. Binyamin (the driver) was killed, and the vehicle lost control and smashed into a wall.

His legacy continues to influence militant and far-right political groups active today in Israel. Kahane publicized his \"Kahanism\" ideology, which he claimed was simply Torah Judaism based on \"halakha\" (Jewish law), through published works, weekly articles, speeches, debates on college campuses and in synagogues throughout the United States, and appearances on various televised programs and radio shows. He was an intense advocate for Jewish causes, such as organizing defense squads and patrols in Jewish neighborhoods and demanding for the Soviet Union to \"release its oppressed Jews\". He supported violence against those he regarded as enemies of the Jewish people, called for immediate Jewish mass migration to Israel to avoid a potential \"Holocaust\" in the United States, supported the restriction of Israel's democracy to its Jewish citizens, hoped that Israel would eventually adopt \"halakha\", and endorsed the annexation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Kahane proposed enforcing \"halakha\" as codified by Maimonides. Non-Jews wishing to dwell in Israel would have three options: remain as \"resident strangers\" with limited rights, leave Israel and receive compensation for their property, or be forcibly removed without compensation. While serving in the Knesset in the mid-1980s Kahane proposed numerous laws, none of which passed, to emphasize Judaism in public schools, reduce Israel's bureaucracy, forbid sexual relations between non-Jews and Jews, and end cultural meetings between Jewish and Arab students. In 1968, Kahane was one of the co-founders of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) in the United States. In 1971, he co-founded Kach (\"Thus\"), a new political party in Israel. The same year, he was convicted in New York for conspiracy to manufacture explosives and received a suspended sentence of five years. In 1984, he became a member of the Knesset, when Kach gained its only-ever seat in parliamentary elections. In 1988, after polls showed Kach gaining popularity, the Israeli government banned Kach for being \"racist\" and \"anti-democratic\" under the terms of a law that it had just passed. Kahane was assassinated in a Manhattan hotel by an Egyptian-born U.S. citizen in November 1990."}

{"question_id": "a1afd051be16d5ac319c457d01f1c9c8", "title": "Emperor Taizong of Song", "context": "Zhao Jiong (20 November 939 \u2013 8 May 997), known as Zhao Guangyi from 960 to 977 and Zhao Kuangyi before 960, also known by his temple name Taizong after his death, was the second emperor of the Song dynasty in China. He reigned from 976 to his death in 997. He was a younger brother of his predecessor Emperor Taizu, and the father of his successor Emperor Zhenzong. Why Emperor Taizong succeeded his brother rather than Emperor Taizu's grown sons (Zhao Dezhao and Zhao Defang, who both died in their twenties during his reign) is not entirely understood by later historians. According to official history, his succession was confirmed by Emperor Taizu on their mother Empress Dowager Du's deathbed as a result of her instruction. A popular story dating back from at least the 11th century suggests that Emperor Taizong murdered his brother in the dim candlelight when the sound of an axe was allegedly heard. Whatever the truth, Zhao Guangyi had been prefect of the Song capital Kaifeng since 961 where he gradually consolidated power. He was the only living prince during Emperor Taizu's reign (as Prince of Jin) and placed above all grand councilors in regular audiences. In the first three years of his reign, he intimidated the Qingyuan warlord Chen Hongjin and Wuyue king Qian Chu into submission and easily conquered Northern Han, thus reunifying China Proper for the first time in 72 years. However, subsequent irredentist wars to conquer former Tang dynasty territories from the Liao dynasty in the north and the Early L\u00ea dynasty in the southwest proved disastrous: after the failures in the Battle of Gaoliang River and the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng, the Sixteen Prefectures and Northern Vietnam (at least in their entirety) would remain beyond Chinese control until the Ming dynasty in the 14th century. Emperor Taizong is remembered as a hardworking and diligent emperor. He paid great attention to the welfare of his people and made the Song Empire more prosperous. He adopted the centralization policies of the Later Zhou, which include increasing agricultural production, broadening the imperial examination system, compiling encyclopaedias, expanding the civil service and further limiting the power of \"jiedushis\". All subsequent emperors of the Northern Song were his descendants, as well as the first emperor of the Southern Song. However, from Emperor Xiaozong onwards, subsequent emperors were descendants of his brother, Emperor Taizu. This largely stemmed from the Jingkang Incident, whereby most of Emperor Taizong's descendants were abducted by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, forcing Emperor Gaozong to seek a successor among Taizu's descendants, as Gaozong's only son had died young."}

{"question_id": "b905a8036c21b1ab08adad36a9ef5a8f", "title": "Sergei Prokofiev", "context": "Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev (27 April [O.S. 15 April] 1891 \u2013 5 March 1953) was a Russian Soviet composer, pianist and conductor. As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres, he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century. His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from \"The Love for Three Oranges,\" the suite \"Lieutenant Kij\u00e9\", the ballet \"Romeo and Juliet\"\u2014from which \"Dance of the Knights\" is taken\u2014and \"Peter and the Wolf. \" Of the established forms and genres in which he worked, he created \u2013 excluding juvenilia \u2013 seven completed operas, seven symphonies, eight ballets, five piano concertos, two violin concertos, a cello concerto, a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra, and nine completed piano sonatas. A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915, Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral \"Scythian Suite\", compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev\u2014\"Chout,Le pas d'acier\" and \"The Prodigal Son\"\u2014which at the time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including \"The Gambler\" and \"The Fiery Angel\". Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was \"The Love for Three Oranges\", composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia. After the Revolution of 1917, Prokofiev left Russia with the official blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky, and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor. During that time, he married a Spanish singer, Carolina (Lina) Codina, with whom he had two sons. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as a pianist, and increasingly turned to the Soviet Union for commissions of new music; in 1936, he finally returned to his homeland with his family. He enjoyed some success there \u2013 notably with \"Lieutenant Kij\u00e9,Peter and the Wolf,Romeo and Juliet,\" and perhaps above all with \"Alexander Nevsky.\" The Nazi invasion of the USSR spurred him to compose his most ambitious work, an operatic version of Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\". In 1948, Prokofiev was attacked for producing \"anti-democratic formalism. \" Nevertheless, he enjoyed personal and artistic support from a new generation of Russian performers, notably Sviatoslav Richter and Mstislav Rostropovich: he wrote his ninth piano sonata for the former and his Symphony-Concerto for the latter."}

Known for his elegance and impeccable manners, he was, by the people who knew him, known as\" the prince\". Waszy\u0144ski was born as Mosze Waks into a Polish Jewish family as Micha\u0142 Waks in 1904 in Kowel, a small town in Volhynia( now in Ukraine), which at the time was part of Imperial Russia. As Germany occupied this part of Europe during World War I, he moved first to Warsaw and later to Berlin. As a young man he worked as an assistant director of the legendary German director F.W. Murnau. Upon his return to Poland he changed his name to Micha\u0142 Waszy\u0144ski and converted to Catholicism. In the 1930s Waszy\u0144ski became the most prolific film director in Poland, directing 37 of the 147 films made in Poland in that decade, nearly one out of four. Along with the popular films in Polish directed to a wide local audience, he directed an important film in Yiddish\" The Dybbuk\", today a monument of the rich cultural life of East European Jewry before the Holocaust. At the beginning of World War II Waszy\u0144ski escaped from Warsaw, which was being bombed by German planes, to Bia\u0142ystok. That city was taken in mid-September 1939 by the Germans, but within weeks, as a result of the Molotov- Ribbentrop pact, the city was given to the Soviet Union and occupied by its army. Waszy\u0144ski began a new career as a theater director, first in Bia\u0142ystok and later in Moscow. In the summer of 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Waszy\u0144ski joined the newly formed Polish Army of general W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders( loyal to the Polish government in Exile in London) and subsequently was relocated to Persia( Iran), and later as a soldier of the 2nd Corps of the Polish Army to Egypt and Italy. As a member of the army film unit, he filmed the Battle of Monte Cassino, where the Polish Army suffered great losses, but helped to win the day. After World War II, he stayed in Italy, where he directed a Polish- language feature film about the Battle of Monte Cassino, and then three Italian films. Later in his career, Waszy\u0144ski worked as a producer for the major American studios in Italy and( primarily) Spain, credited as\" Michael Waszynski\". His credits include\" The Quiet American\"( 1958)( associate producer),\" El Cid\"( 1961), and\" The Fall of the Roman Empire( film)\"( 1964)( executive producer and associate producer). He died of a heart attack on 20 February 1965 in Madrid, and was buried in a ceremonious Catholic funeral in Rome."}

After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, the early 1890s saw him become one of the most popular playwrights in London. He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays, his novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", and the circumstances of his criminal conviction for \"gross indecency\", imprisonment, and early death at age 46. Wilde's parents were successful Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. A young Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German. At university, Wilde read Greats; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional classicist, first at Trinity College Dublin, then at Oxford. He became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism, led by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles. As a spokesman for aestheticism, he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new \"English Renaissance in Art\" and interior decoration, and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day. At the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into what would be his only novel, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote \"Salome\" (1891) in French while in Paris but it was refused a licence for England due to an absolute prohibition on the portrayal of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late-Victorian London. At the height of his fame and success, while \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895) was still being performed in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials he was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison, he wrote \"De Profundis\" (published posthumously in 1905), a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. On his release, he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\" (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life."}

Boyle", "context": "Robert Francis Boyle (October 10, 1909 \u2013 August 1, 2010) was an American film art director and production designer. Born in Los Angeles, Boyle trained as an architect, graduating from the University of Southern California (USC). When he lost his job in that field during the Great Depression, Boyle found work in films as an extra. In 1933 he was hired as a draftsman in the Paramount Pictures art department, headed by supervising art director Hans Dreier. Beginning with Cecil B. DeMille's \"The Plainsman\", Boyle went on to work on a variety of pictures as a sketch artist, draftsman and assistant art director before becoming an art director at Universal Studios in the early 1940s. Boyle collaborated several times with Alfred Hitchcock, first as an associate art director for \"Saboteur\" (1942) and later as a full-fledged production designer for \"North by Northwest\" (1959), \"The Birds\" (1963), and \"Marnie\" (1964). Denied permission to shoot footage on Mount Rushmore, Hitchcock turned to Boyle to create realistic replicas of the stone heads. Boyle abseiled down the monument, photographing its contours in detail, before constructing \"just enough to put the actors on so we could get down shots, up shots, side shots, whatever we needed. \" Almost two decades earlier, Boyle had delivered the Statue of Liberty reproduction that was used in the climactic scene of \"Saboteur\". For \"The Birds\", Boyle was put in charge of the title characters. He later recalled, \"We needed to find out which birds we could use best, and finally settled on two types: sea gulls, which were very greedy beasts that would always fly toward the camera if there was a piece of meat, and crows, which had a strange sort of intelligence.\" Boyle described his relationship with Hitchcock: \"It was a meeting of equals: the director who knew exactly what he wanted, and the art director who knew how to get it done.\" When director Norman Jewison failed in his attempts to get the necessary submarine that was at the center of his \"The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming\" storyline, Boyle built a working model from styrofoam and fiberglass. Boyle's other credits include \"It Came from Outer SpaceCape FearIn Cold BloodFiddler on the RoofPortnoy's ComplaintWinter KillsW.C. Fields and MeThe ShootistPrivate BenjaminStaying Alive\", and \"Troop Beverly Hills\". During the course of his career, Boyle was nominated four times for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, but never won. In 1997 he received the Art Directors Guild's Lifetime Achievement Award, and he was voted an Honorary Academy Award by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, \"in recognition of one of cinema's great careers in art direction,\" which he received during the 80th Academy Awards ceremony on February 24, 2008. At the age of 98, Boyle became the oldest winner ever of an Honorary Award in the history of the Academy Awards. In ill health and arriving to the ceremony in a wheelchair, Boyle insisted on walking onstage, alongside Nicole Kidman, to receive the honor. He was the subject of the Academy Award-nominated documentary short \"The Man on Lincoln's Nose\" (2000)."}

He played keyboards in a number of bands before finding his first commercial success with the Nice in the late 1960s. He became internationally famous for his work with the Nice, which included writing rock arrangements of classical music. After leaving the Nice in 1970, he was a founding member of Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP), one of the early progressive rock supergroups. Emerson, Lake & Palmer were commercially successful through much of the 1970s, becoming one of the best-known progressive rock groups of the era. Emerson wrote and arranged much of ELP's music on albums such as \"Tarkus\" (1971) and \"Brain Salad Surgery\" (1973), combining his own original compositions with classical or traditional pieces adapted into a rock format. Following ELP's break-up at the end of the 1970s, Emerson pursued a solo career, composed several film soundtracks, and formed the bands Emerson, Lake & Powell and 3 to carry on in the style of ELP. In the early 1990s, Emerson rejoined ELP, which reunited for two more albums and several tours before breaking up again in the late 1990s. Emerson also reunited the Nice in 2002 for a tour. During the 2000s, Emerson resumed his solo career, including touring with his own Keith Emerson Band featuring guitarist Marc Bonilla and collaborating with several orchestras. He reunited with ELP bandmate Greg Lake in 2010 for a duo tour, culminating in a one-off ELP reunion show in London to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary. Emerson's last album, \"The Three Fates Project\", with Marc Bonilla and Terje Mikkelsen, was released in 2012. Emerson reportedly suffered from depression and alcoholism, and in his later years developed nerve damage that hampered his playing, making him anxious about upcoming performances. He died by suicide on 11 March 2016 at his home in Santa Monica, California. Emerson was widely regarded as one of the top keyboard players of the progressive rock era. AllMusic describes Emerson as \"perhaps the greatest, most technically accomplished keyboardist in rock history\"."}

He also wrote about 500 cabaret songs, chamber music, and orchestral and choral works. His original name was actually Strauss, but for professional purposes he deliberately omitted the final 's', since he wished not to be associated with the musical Strauss family of Vienna. However, he did follow the advice of Johann Strauss II in 1898 about abandoning the prospective lure of writing waltzes for the more lucrative business of writing for the theatre. The son of a Jewish family, he studied music in Berlin under Max Bruch, and became an orchestral conductor, working at the \u00dcberbrettl cabaret. He went back to Vienna and began writing operettas, becoming a serious rival to Franz Leh\u00e1r. When Leh\u00e1r's popular \"The Merry Widow\" premiered in 1905, Straus was said to have remarked \"Das kann ich auch!\" (I can also do that!). In 1939, following the Nazi Anschluss, he fled to Paris, where he received the honour of a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, and then to Hollywood. After the war, he returned to Europe, and settled at Bad Ischl, where he died. His grave is in the Bad Ischl Friedhof. Straus' best-known works are \"Ein WalzertraumA Waltz Dream\"), and \"The Chocolate SoldierDer tapfere Soldat\"). The waltz arrangement from the former is probably his most enduring orchestral work. Among his most famous works is the theme from the 1950 film \"La Ronde\"."}

In some stylistic terms, particularly his fine drawings, Nearchos seems closely connected to the Painter of Acropolis 606. Unlike his contemporaries, he achieved figures with a striking sense of dignity, comparable to those painted much later by Exekias. Especially striking is a \"kantharos\", probably both shaped and painted by Nearchos, which depicts Achilles harnessing his horses. \" Kantharoi\" were one of his favourite shapes, and he signed them as both potter and painter. He also introduced some innovations, such as the attempt to render a horse's body in white paint. Not all his experiments can be considered successful. A further vessel that exemplifies his artistic mastery is an \"aryballos\" in the Corinthian style, decorated with a frieze of pygmies and cranes along the rim. Strikingly, the vessel is less than 8 cm tall and the frieze only covers a fraction of its surface. Nerachos also produced Little-master cups."}

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame."}

It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Southern Bug, Dniester, Don, and the Rioni. Areas of many countries drain into the Black Sea, including Germany, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. The Black Sea has an area of( not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of, and a volume of. It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south, Caucasus Mountains to the east, Crimean Mountains to the north, Strandzha to the southwest, Balkan Mountains to the west, Dobrogea Plateau to the northwest, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east \u2013 west extent is about. Important cities along the coast include Odessa, Sevastopol, Samsun, and Istanbul. The Black Sea is bordered by Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, and Russia. It has a positive water balance; that is, a net outflow of water per year through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea. There is a two- way hydrological exchange: the more saline and therefore denser, but warmer, Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea under its less saline outflow. This creates a significant anoxic layer well below the surface waters. The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea, via the Aegean Sea and various straits, and is navigable to the Atlantic Ocean. The Bosphorus Strait connects it to the Sea of Marmara, and the Strait of the Dardanelles connects that sea to the Aegean Sea region of the Mediterranean. The Black Sea is also connected, to the north, to the Sea of Azov by the Kerch Strait. The water level has varied significantly over geological time. Due to these variations in the water level in the basin, the surrounding shelf and associated aprons have sometimes been dry land. At certain critical water levels, connections with surrounding water bodies can become established. It is through the most active of these connective routes, the Turkish Straits, that the Black Sea joins the world ocean. During geological periods when this hydrological link was n't present, the Black Sea was an endorheic basin, operating independently of the global ocean system( similar to the Caspian Sea nowadays). Currently, the Black Sea water level is relatively high; thus, water is being exchanged with the Mediterranean. The Turkish Straits connect the Black Sea with the Aegean Sea and comprise the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles. The Black Sea undersea river is a current of particularly saline water flowing through the Bosphorus Strait and along the seabed of the Black Sea. The discovery of the river announced on August 1, 2010, was made by scientists at the University of Leeds and is the first of its kind in the world. The undersea river stems from salty water spilling through the Bosphorus Strait from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea, where the water has a lower salt content."}

Emperor Gaozong was the son of Emperor Taizong and Empress Zhangsun. Emperor Gaozong was aided in his rule by Empress Wu during the later years of his reign after a series of strokes left him incapacitated. Emperor Gaozong delegated all matters of state to his Strong wife and after he died in 683, power fell completely into the hands of Empress Wu, who subsequently became the only Empress regnant in Chinese history. After his death, he was interred at the Qianling Mausoleum along with Wu Zetian. Historians have generally viewed Emperor Gaozong as a weak ruler, inattentive to the business of the state and leaving such business to his powerful wife Empress Wu. During the first part of his reign, Tang territorial gains, which started with his father Emperor Taizong, continued, including the conquest of Baekje, Goguryeo, and the Western Turkic Khaganate, but throughout the 670s, much of those gains were lost to the Tibetan Empire, Silla, Khitan, and Balhae.

His work as a director includes\" Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\"( 1995),\" Mohabbatein\"( 2000),\" Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\"( 2008) and\" Befikre\"( 2016). He is also the current Chairman of India's multi-national film, media and entertainment conglomerate Yash Raj Films( YRF). Chopra has written and produced a number of films under the banner such as\" Veer- Zaara\"( 2004),\" Fanaa\"( 2006),\" Band Baaja Baaraat\"( 2010),\" Jab Tak Hai Jaan\"( 2012), the\" Dhoom series\"( 2004, 2006& 2013),\" Sultan\"( 2016), the\" Tiger series\"( 2012& 2017) and\" War\"( 2019). He has broken away from typecast through production of off- beat films such as\" Kabul Express\"( 2006),\" Chak De! India\"( 2007),( 2009),\" Dum Laga Ke Haisha\"( 2015) and\" Hichki!\"( 2018), that do not necessarily fit into the realm of\" masala films\". Chopra is also the first to move towards a true film studio model through independent projects helmed by talent under his banner. Major post-production work of the company is now carried out of YRF Studios( co- founded by his ex-wife Payal Khanna), where Chopra serves as Chief Executive. He has produced ten films that have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of more than 200 crore, which is the most for an Indian film producer. In December 2009, Chopra fought a hostile acquisition bid by Walt Disney, valued upwards of 2500 crore, to remain and continue purely as a domestic entity aided by the Tata Sons. Apart from emerging as an equitable brand, his company has earned the status of a movie mogul through distribution networks spread across the globe, estimated to be net worth 7640 crore( FY17/18) by the NSE, thereby making it the biggest and most successful film production company in the history of Indian Cinema. Having denied him admission into the NSD as a young applicant, the Directorate of Film Festivals eventually honored him with the National Award for his achievements in 1995, 2005, 2007 and 2015. The Government of India appealed both Chopra and Mani Ratnam to focus on content created locally under its Make in India initiative, which was later followed by productions like\" Daawat- e- Ishq\"( 2014),\" Meri Pyaari Bindu\"( 2016),\" Sui- Dhaaga\"( 2018) and\" Jayeshbhai Jordaar\"( 2020) planned by his company. In June 2018, he was awarded membership into The Academy by the Producers Guild of America. Widely regarded as one of the most influential and powerful executives in Indian entertainment, Chopra has however rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Yash Chopra's son and the Chief Executive of Yash Raj Films. He has remained extremely media -shy and a passive individual, battling constant reports of an alleged dysthymic disorder throughout his three- decade career, resulting in very few public photos of him being in existence."}

One of the most popular and highest-paid Hindi film actresses in the 2000s, she has received several awards, including seven Filmfare Awards. Her roles have been cited in the media as a significant departure from previous screen portrayals of Indian women. Although Mukerji was born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry, she did not aspire to pursue a career in film. However, while still a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in her father's Bengali language film \"Biyer Phool\" (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama \"Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat\" on the insistence of her mother. She then began a full-time career in films and the 1998 action drama \"Ghulam\" was her first commercial success. She gained wider recognition for a supporting role in the romance \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" (1998). The year 2002 marked a turning point for Mukerji when she was cast by Yash Raj Films as the star of the drama \"Saathiya\". By 2004, Mukerji had established herself as a leading actress of Bollywood with roles in the romantic comedy \"Hum Tum\" and the dramas \"Yuva\" and \"Veer-Zaara\". She achieved further success for portraying a deaf, blind and mute woman in the acclaimed drama \"Black\" (2005), a con woman in \"Bunty Aur Babli\" (2005) and an unhappily married woman in \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" (2006). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. The semi-biographical thriller \"No One Killed Jessica\" (2011), in which she played a headstrong journalist, proved to be her first box office hit in four years. She followed it by starring in the successful thrillers  (2012) and \"Mardaani\" (2014), and the comedy-drama \"Hichki\" (2018). The latter emerged as her highest-grossing release. In addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show \"Dance Premier League\". Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker Aditya Chopra, with whom she has a daughter."}

William was born in and died in D\u00fcsseldorf. He was the only son of John III, Duke of J\u00fclich- Cleves- Berg, and Maria, Duchess of J\u00fclich- Berg. William took over rule of his father's estates( the Duchy of Cleves and the County of Mark) upon his death in 1539. Despite his mother having lived until 1543, William also became the Duke of Berg and J\u00fclich and the Count of Ravensberg. From 1538 to 1543, William held the neighbouring Duchy of Guelders, as successor of his distant relatives, the Egmond dukes. Emperor Charles V claimed this duchy for himself as the dukes had sold their right of heritage, and William tried to hold on to it. He made a treaty with the King of France and married Jeanne d'Albret, and with this backup dared to challenge the Emperor. All too soon he learned that the French did not lift a finger to help him, and he was overwhelmed and had to surrender. In accordance with the Treaty of Venlo( 1543) that was the result of this war, Guelders and the County of Zutphen were transferred to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, combining them with the Habsburg Netherlands. William then tried to strengthen his inherited territories and launched an impressive development project for the most important cities. The three duchies all got new main fortresses as major strongpoints, for the older medieval fortifications had proved to be no match against the Imperial artillery. The cities of J\u00fclich, D\u00fcsseldorf and Orsoy became fortresses for the duchies of J\u00fclich, Berg and Cleves respectively, and J\u00fclich and D\u00fcsseldorf were turned into impressive residences. For this task, the renowned Italian architect Alessandro Pasqualini from Bologna was hired, who had already made some impressive display of his craft in the Netherlands. He made the plans for the fortifications and palaces, of which some traces still remain, especially at J\u00fclich where the citadel( built 1548- 1580) is a major landmark, with parts of the Renaissance palace still standing. William's sister Anne of Cleves was, for six months, the fourth wife of King Henry VIII of England. Through his daughter Marie Eleonore, he is ancestor of Marie Louise of Hesse- Kassel, wife of John William Friso, Prince of Orange therefore ancestor of all the current European monarchs."}

Once she has been rescued the three return to civilization and enter the world of professional Hitmen. Similar to virtually all Scott Shaw films, this feature is made up of bizarre story twists and is filmed with a backdrop of several spectacular locations.

{"question_id": "f530537804cb1b7c32ddbe955de5a403", "title": "Fulgencio Batista", "context": "Fulgencio Batista y Zald\u00edvar (born Rub\u00e9n Zald\u00edvar; January 16, 1901 \u2013 August 6, 1973) was a Cuban military officer and politician who served as the elected President of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, and as its U.S.-backed military dictator from 1952 to 1959, before being overthrown during the Cuban Revolution. Batista initially rose to power as part of the 1933 Revolt of the Sergeants, which overthrew the provisional government of Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes y Quesada. He then appointed himself chief of the armed forces, with the rank of colonel, and effectively controlled the five-member \"pentarchy\" that functioned as the collective head of state. He maintained this control through a string of puppet presidents until 1940, when he was himself elected President of Cuba on a populist platform. He then instated the 1940 Constitution of Cuba and served until 1944. After finishing his term he lived in Florida, returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952. Facing certain electoral defeat, he led a military coup against President Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s that preempted the election. Back in power, and receiving financial, military, and logistical support from the United States government, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans. Eventually it reached the point where most of the sugar industry was in U.S. hands, and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land. As such, Batista's repressive government then began to systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba's commercial interests, by negotiating lucrative relationships with both the American Mafia, who controlled the drug, gambling, and prostitution businesses in Havana, and with large U.S.-based multinational companies who were awarded lucrative contracts. To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace\u2014which was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations\u2014Batista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities secret police to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions. These murders mounted in 1957, as Fidel Castro gained more publicity and influence. Many people were killed, with estimates ranging from hundreds to about 20,000 people killed. Catalyzing the resistance to such tactics, for two years (December 1956 \u2013 December 1958) Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement and other nationalist rebelling elements led an urban and rural-based guerrilla uprising against Batista's government, which culminated in his eventual defeat by rebels under the command of Che Guevara at the Battle of Santa Clara on New Year's Day 1959. Batista immediately fled the island with an amassed personal fortune to the Dominican Republic, where strongman and previous military ally Rafael Trujillo held power. Batista eventually found political asylum in Oliveira Salazar's Portugal, where he first lived on the island of Madeira and then in Estoril, outside Lisbon. He was involved in business activities in Spain and was staying there in Guadalmina near Marbella at the time of his death from a heart attack on August 6, 1973."}

{"question_id": "1c671369224161b29553731807c7ae04", "title": "Sidney Poitier", "context": "Sir Sidney Poitier,( born February 20, 1927) is a Bahamian- American actor and film director. He received two nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor, winning one, the first black actor to win that award. He was also nominated six times for each of the Golden Globe for Best Actor and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award( BAFTA) for Best Foreign Actor, winning each once. From 1997 to 2007, he served as the Bahamian Ambassador to Japan. His family lived in the Bahamas but Poitier was born in Miami while they were visiting, thereby acquiring American citizenship. He grew up in the Bahamas, moving to New York when he was 16. He joined the North American Negro Theatre landing his breakthrough film role in 1950 as an incorrigible high school student in\" Blackboard Jungle\"( 1955). In 1958 Poitier starred with Tony Curtis in the critically acclaimed\" The Defiant Ones\" as chained- together convicts who escape and must cooperate. Each received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, with Poitier's being the first for a black actor, as well as nominations for the BAFTAs, which Poitier won. In 1964 he won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for his role in\" Lilies of the Field\"( 1963) in which he played a handyman who stays with and helps a group of German- speaking nuns build a chapel. Poitier also received critical acclaim for\" A Raisin in the Sun\"( 1961) and\" A Patch of Blue\"( 1965). He continued to break ground in three successful 1967 films, each dealing with issues of race and race relations:\" To Sir, with LoveGuess Who's Coming to Dinner\", and\" In the Heat of the Night\", making him the top box- office star of that year. He received nominations for the Golden Globes and BAFTAs for the latter film, but not for the Oscars, likely due to vote splitting between his roles. After twice reprising his Virgil Tibbs character from\" In the Heat of the Night\" and acting in a variety of other films, including the thriller\" The Wilby Conspiracy\"( 1975), with Michael Caine, Poiter turned to acting/ directing with the action- comedies\" Uptown Saturday Night\"( 1974),\" Let's Do It Again\"( 1975), and\" A Piece of the Action\"( 1978), all co-starring Bill Cosby. During a decade away from acting he directed the successful\" Stir Crazy\"( 1980) starring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, among other films. He returned to acting in the late 1980s and early 1990s in a few thrillers and television roles. Poitier was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. In 2009 Poitier was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest civilian honor. In 2016, he was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship for outstanding lifetime achievement in film. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Poitier 22nd on their list of Greatest Male Stars of classic Hollywood cinema. In 2002 Poitier was chosen to receive an Academy Honorary Award, in recognition of his\" remarkable accomplishments as an artist and as a human being\"."}

He studied at the \"Colegio de los Padres Franceses\" and later moved to Paris, where he completed three years of law before returning to Chile.

He married Elena Calvo Cruchaga in 1877. Manuel Bulnes was elected a deputy for Mulch\u00e9n in 1879.

{"question_id": "612e3b685747767f13cbbedb4d6b9bb2", "title": "Ansur Fern\u00e1ndez", "context": "Ansur, Assur, or Asur Fern\u00e1ndez( died 947/50) was a powerful Castilian nobleman and military leader in the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n during the reign of Ramiro II. He was the first Count of Monz\u00f3n, probably from before 939, certainly by 943, and he was Count of Castile in 943\u201345 in opposition to the deposed Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. His family was known as the Banu Ansur(\" Banu Anshur\") or Ans\u00farez( Assuriz). The earliest reference to Ansur is found in a document dated 4 March 921, wherein he is named with his parents Fernando Ans\u00farez and Muniadonna in a donation in the vicinity of Burgos to San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a. His father is not mentioned after 929, but the date of his death is unknown. The leader of the Banu Ans\u00farez who allied with the Banu G\u00f3mez in rebellion against Ramiro in favour of his abdicated brother Alfonso IV in the spring of 932 may have already been Ansur. If so, he was already a count by that time. According to the\" Anales castellanos primeros\", he participated in the Battle of Simancas in 939, where he is one of only two participating counts named, the other being Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez of Castile. This indication of his importance and his high rank may also indicate that by then the county of Monz\u00f3n had already been created by Ramiro II for him. In July 941 Ramiro associated the counts of the Banu Ans\u00farez and G\u00f3mez families as well as Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez and Sancho Garc\u00e9s II of Pamplona with him in a peace treaty signed with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. Despite that Ansur bore the title\" count\" as early as 939, the earliest direct reference to the county of Monz\u00f3n is from a diploma of 26 December 943, which reads\" regnante Ranimiro in Obeto et in Legione et comite Assur Fredinandiz in Montson\"( Ramiro reigning in Oviedo and Le\u00f3n and Count Ansur Fern\u00e1ndez in Monz\u00f3n). By this act Ansur, his wife Guntroda, and their children \u2014 Fernando, Oveco, Mu\u00f1o, Nu\u00f1o, Gutierre, Gonzalo, and Teresa\u2014donated the village of Fuente Adrada near Sacramenia to the monastery of San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a. The gift was confirmed by a\" Domna Toda\", who signs right after the king. This may have been Toda of Navarre. A charter dated 1 August 937 refers to\" Assuri dominans Menduniae\"( Ansur ruling\" Mendunia\", a corruption of Monz\u00f3n), but there appears to be an error in the dating clause; the correct date is probably 1 March 947. After Ramiro deposed Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez in Castile, he appointed his own son, the future Sancho I, as count with Ansur acting as his\" regent\". By May 944 Sancho was in Burgos. There are four surviving charters from Ansur's brief reign in Castile; the earliest from November 943. The latest is dated to 1 December 945, though according to other sources Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez was reinstated in Castile on 22 April that year. Nonetheless, the reinstated Fern\u00e1n signed royal documents below Ansur, indicating a reversal of rank. Ansur's only known daughter, Teresa, married Ramiro II's son Sancho I and was the mother of Ramiro III. She inherited, and her son through her, the county of Monz\u00f3n after the death of Ansur's eldest son and successor, Fernando, in 978. In 976 Fernando boasted that his father had remained always faithful to his monarch and had served him with valour in a thousand battles."}

With the fall of his uncle, king Sancho IV of Navarre, the kingdom was divided between Castile and Aragon, and the royal family parceled out between the two.

During the Early Middle Ages, he united the majority of western and central Europe. He was the first recognised emperor to rule from western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded is called the Carolingian Empire. He was later canonized by Antipope Paschal III. Charlemagne was the eldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon, born before their canonical marriage. He became king in 768 following his father's death, initially as co-ruler with his brother Carloman I. Carloman's sudden death in December 771 under unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne the sole ruler of the Frankish Kingdom. He continued his father's policy towards the papacy and became its protector, removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain. He campaigned against the Saxons to his east, Christianizing them upon penalty of death and leading to events such as the Massacre of Verden. He reached the height of his power in 800 when he was crowned \"Emperor of the Romans\" by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day at Rome's Old St. Peter's Basilica. Charlemagne has been called the \"Father of EuropePater Europae\"), as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the classical era of the Roman Empire and united parts of Europe that had never been under Frankish or Roman rule. His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance, a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church. Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire considered themselves successors of Charlemagne, as did the French and German monarchs. The Eastern Orthodox Church viewed Charlemagne less favorably due to his support of the filioque and the Pope's having preferred him as Emperor over the Byzantine Empire's Irene of Athens. These and other disputes led to the eventual split of Rome and Constantinople in the Great Schism of 1054. Charlemagne died in 814 and was laid to rest in his imperial capital city of Aachen. He married at least four times and had three legitimate sons who lived to adulthood, but only the youngest of them, Louis the Pious, survived to succeed him."}

Wilbert was a priest in Cologne Cathedral when archbishop Gunther was excommunicated and deposed. Charles the Bald, king of West Francia, tried to install his own palatine cleric, Hilduin, as archbishop. He failed when Louis the German, king of East Francia, sent Liutbert, archbishop of Mainz, to consecrate the priest Wilbert instead. On 7 January 870, Wilbert was acclaimed by Liutbert with the consent of the clergy and people of the diocese, with Odilbald of Utrecht assisting the consecration. Pope Hadrian II sent an embassy under Wibod, bishop of Parma, carrying his letters of acceptance. His appointment was made rapidly in order to foil any attempt by Louis's rival, Charles the Bald, to fill the vacant see with a candidate favourable to him. Charles did succeed in placing Bertulf in power in the archdiocese of Trier. Wilbert received the contested pallium from Pope Hadrian in 875. He extended the cathedral for use in holding synods, held the first provincial synod of his province there in 887, and was the first archbishop buried in the cathedral in 889. On 26 September 870, a German synod, attended by Liutbert and Bertulf, was held in Cologne with all the bishops of Saxony. The cathedral, desecrated by Gunther, was reconsecrated to Saint Peter. On 4 July 876, Wilbert led an embassy of German bishops to Charles the Bald's synod at Ponthion to claim for Louis the German a part in the inheritance of the late Emperor Louis II of Italy. The synod rebuffed them, since Pope John VIII was a strong supporter of Charles, and forced them to take an oath of fidelity to Ansegis, one of Charles's churchmen, whom the pope had appointed legate for all Europe north of the Alps. After Louis the German's death, Charles the Bald disputed the right of the former's heir, Louis the Younger, to receive Louis's share of Lotharingia. On 7 October 876, Charles was preparing a surprise attach on Louis the Younger, when Wilbert discovered the plot and warned Louis. The ensuing battle was a defeat for Charles. Cologne was pillaged and razed by Vikings in 881\u2013882, but Liutbert of Mainz assisted in rebuilding it. Wilbert and Henry of Franconia met the Viking leader Godfrid, Duke of Frisia, at Herespich, an island in the confluence of the Rhine and the Waal. At the meeting, Godfrid was killed and Wilbert persuaded Gisela, his wife, to leave the island and pursue a policy of peace."}

He was the second son of Charles the Bald and brother of Louis the Stammerer. The younger Charles was appointed by his father, who had previously ruled as King of Aquitaine himself from 838, as a sop to Aquitainian separatism. The Aquitainians had previously rebelled against Charles the Bald, requesting from Louis the German that he send one of his sons to rule over them. Louis had sent his second son, Louis the Younger, prompting Charles the Bald to release his rival claimant to Aquitaine, Pippin II. Pippin succeeded in rallying the nobles to support himself and Charles the Bald against Louis the Younger, who was driven out. By October, however, Pippin lost his popularity with the still- rebellious Aquitainians, prompting Charles the Bald to appoint Charles the Child as King. Charles the Child was duly anointed at Limoges. Within a year, he had been replaced by the Aquitainians with Pippin II. These same then deposed Pippin and restored Charles the Child. Pippin was captured in 864 and imprisoned at Senlis, at which point he disappears from history. Unlike previous sub-kings of Aquitaine,( Louis the Pious, Pippin I, Pippin II), Charles the Child had no real authority at all. Before 840, the kingdom had been ruled in person by an autonomous king; Charles the Bald, however, after his accession as King of Western Francia, attempted to maintain power in Aquitaine. Consequently, Charles the Child, and his brother, Louis the Stammerer, did not rule in person, had no chancery, could issue no instruments; they were no longer empowered to bestow privileges, endow religious establishments, or dispose of royal property. All the rights of the region were invested in Charles the Bald, in whose absence the nobles of the Kingdom gathered power. Nonetheless, as Charles grew older, he began to exercise what little personal authority he could. For example, in 862 he chose and married a wife against the will of his father. The name of his wife is unknown, although she was apparently the widow of a count named Humbert. Charles the Bald reasserted his power over his son in 863, forcing the younger Charles to put away his wife and be loyal to his father. A year later, he was accidentally struck with a sword in the head by a member of his own hunting party in a mock combat, leading Ado of Vienne to say that\" Charles was dishonoured(\" dehonestatus\") by having suffered it\". The blow left him mentally incapacitated until his resultant death in 866. He died childless and was buried in Bourges."}

She was the daughter of Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona and his wife Auria. At the time of Onneca's birth, which occurred between 848 and 850, the Iberian Peninsula was largely under the domination of the Muslim Umayyad dynasty. Only the northern kingdoms of Asturias, Pamplona and the Pyrenean threshold remained under control of Christian rulers. Onneca was a member of the \u00cd\u00f1iguez dynasty, named after her great-grandfather \u00cd\u00f1igo Arista, who founded the Kingdom of Pamplona. Information about Onneca's life is limited. Biographical details about her come from two main sources: the \"C\u00f3dice de Roda\" and the accounts of Muslim Andalusi historians, who refer to the grandmother of Abd al-Rahman III by the Arabic name Durr , meaning \"pearl\". Her marriage created family ties between the Christian and Muslim ruling families of the Iberian peninsula, initially leading to close collaboration between the Christian House of \u00cd\u00f1iguez and the Muslim Umayyads. The political effects resulting from Onneca's marriages continued to be felt long after her death, which occurred at an unknown date."}

After taking office, he initiated sweeping reforms, resulting in the approval of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg to a constitution on September 25, 1819. In his 48-year reign, the kingdom moved from one that was created from different denominational principalities and a heterogeneous agricultural country, into a constitutional state with a common identity and a well-organised management. In addition to his successful domestic policy, he pursued throughout his reign an ambition focused on German and European foreign policy. Alongside the great powers of Prussia and Austria, he imagined a third major German power in the form of Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover and W\u00fcrttemberg. Although this plan never succeeded, it ensured a consistent, coherent and targeted policy during his reign. William was the only German monarch who was forced to recognise the Frankfurt Constitution of 1848. After the failure of the March Revolution of 1848, he pursued restorative policies that counteracted his liberal image from before the revolution.

His Polish- Jewish parents moved the family back from Paris to Krak\u00f3w in 1937. Two years later, Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany starting World War II and the Polanskis found themselves trapped in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto.

In the early stages of his reign, Orhan focused his energies on conquering most of northwestern Anatolia. The majority of these areas were under Byzantine rule and he won his first battle at Pelekanon against the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. Orhan also occupied the lands of the Karasids of Bal\u0131kesir and the Ahis of Ankara. A series of civil wars surrounding the ascension of the nine-year-old Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos greatly benefited Orhan. In the Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347, the regent John VI Kantakouzenos married his daughter Theodora to Orhan and employed Ottoman warriors against the rival forces of the empress dowager, allowing them to loot Thrace. In the Byzantine civil war of 1352\u20131357, Kantakouzenos used Ottoman forces against John V, granting them the use of a European fortress at \u00c7impe around 1352.

In North America, it was also issued as the B-side of the album's lead single,\" Blow Away\", while in Britain and some other markets it was the B-side of the follow- up,\" Love Comes to Everyone\". The lyrics recall Harrison's experiences under the hallucinatory effects of magic mushrooms while holidaying on the Hawaiian island of Maui. The song title refers to Hana, a remote town on the island, and is a play on that of the 1920s ragtime tune\" Hard Hearted Hannah\". Harrison began writing the song in Los Angeles in response to Ted Templeman, a staff producer at Warner Bros. Records, suggesting he compose something in a similar style to his 1971 track\" Deep Blue\". He wrote the lyrics in Hawaii in February 1978, during the main writing period for\" George Harrison\", his first album in over two years. Recorded at Harrison's FPSHOT studio in Oxfordshire, the track features dobro, jazz piano, tuba and prominent chorus vocals, as well as voices and sounds captured in his local pub. The musical arrangement recalls the music hall tradition, while the composition's old- time qualities reflect Harrison's earliest influences from the pre-rock and roll era. The other musicians on the recording include Neil Larsen and Stevie Winwood. The song's lyrics employ, variously, psychedelic imagery, rhyming slang, humorous non sequiturs and John Keats- like symbolism. The song was well received by several music critics and revealed a comedic side of Harrison that was relatively unfamiliar to listeners. Author Simon Leng recognises\" Soft- Hearted Hana\" as the start of the\" Pythonization of Harrison's music\", referring to the Monty Python comedy troupe and Harrison's role as a film producer of British comedies such as\" Monty Python's Life of Brian\"."}

He was born at Rome to a prominent branch of the \"gens Claudia\", the son of Tiberius and his first wife, Vipsania Agrippina. His name at birth was Nero Claudius Drusus after his paternal uncle, Drusus the Elder. In AD 4, he assumed the name \"Julius Caesar\" following his father's adoption into the Julii by Augustus, and became Drusus Julius Caesar. Drusus first entered politics with the office of quaestor in AD 10. His political career mirrored that of Germanicus, and he assumed all his offices at the same age as him. Following the model of Augustus, it was intended that the two would rule together. They were both popular, and many dedications have been found in their honor across Roman Italy. Cassius Dio calls him \"Castor\" in his \"Roman History\", likening Drusus and Germanicus to the twins, Castor and Pollux, of Roman mythology. Drusus died suddenly 14 September 23, seemingly from natural causes. Ancient historians, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, claim he died amid a feud with the powerful Sejanus, Praetorian prefect of Rome. They allege that he had been murdered. In their account, Sejanus had seduced his wife Livilla, and with the help of a doctor she had poisoned Drusus. Despite the rumors, Tiberius did not suspect Sejanus and the two remained friends until Sejanus' fall from grace in 31."}

Photographs showed Giuliani, a 23- year- old Roman living in Genoa, throwing a fire extinguisher towards the van, a pistol firing a shot in return from the van, and Giuliani's body having been run over by the van. Charges against the officer were initially dropped without trial as a judge ruled that the ricocheted bullet was fired in self- defense, but the incident became a point of public scrutiny. The European Court of Human Rights, eight years after the incident, ruled that the Italian forces had acted within their limits, though damages were awarded for the state's procedural handling of the case. Appeals upheld the ruling, and Giuliani's family later filed a civil suit. Giuliani was memorialized in music tributes and public monuments, and is remembered as a symbol of the 2001 G8 protests.

In Judaism, he is the founding father of the covenant of the pieces, the special relationship between the Hebrews and God; in Christianity, he is the prototype of all believers, Jewish or Gentile; and in Islam he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad. The narrative in the Book of Genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land. Abraham is called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land originally given to Canaan but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham; and, while promises are made to Ishmael about founding a great nation, Isaac, Abraham's son by his half-sister Sarah, inherits God's promises to Abraham. Abraham purchases a tomb (the Cave of the Patriarchs) at Hebron to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin, thus ruling the Canaanites out of any inheritance. Abraham later marries Keturah and has six more sons; but, on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives \"all Abraham's goods\", while the other sons receive only \"gifts\" (Genesis 25:5\u20138). The Abraham story cannot be definitively related to any specific time, and it is widely agreed that the patriarchal age, along with the exodus and the period of the judges, is a late literary construct that does not relate to any period in actual history. A common hypothesis among scholars is that it was composed in the early Persian period (late 6th century BCE) as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the Babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their \"father Abraham\", and the returning exiles who based their counter-claim on Moses and the Exodus tradition."}

{"question_id": "907fb0ab6152ea801c08f2f1ac9d2080", "title": "Alfred Hitchcock", "context": "Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock,( 13 August 1899 \u2013 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and extensively studied filmmakers in the history of cinema. Known as\" the Master of Suspense\", he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology\" Alfred Hitchcock Presents\"( 1955 \u2013 1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph- cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film\" The Pleasure Garden\"( 1925). His first successful film,( 1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film,\" Blackmail\", was the first British. Two of his 1930s thrillers,\" The 39 Steps\"( 1935) and\" The Lady Vanishes\"( 1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including\" Rebecca\"( 1940),\" Foreign Correspondent\"( 1940),\" Suspicion\"( 1941),\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943), and\" Notorious\"( 1946). \" Rebecca\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for\" Lifeboat\"( 1944) and\" Spellbound\"( 1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The\" Hitchcockian\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film\" is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\" After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with\" Strangers on a Train\"( 1951) and\" Dial M For Murder\"( 1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time:\" Rear Window\"( 1954),\" Vertigo\"( 1958),\" North by Northwest\"( 1959), and\" Psycho\"( 1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012,\" Vertigo\" replaced Orson Welles's\" Citizen Kane\"( 1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world- wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite,\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died."}

Neugebauer was born in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany and is the son of Otto Neugebauer, an Austrian-American mathematician and historian of science, and Grete Bruck. After moving to the United States at age seven, he received his A.B. in physics from Cornell University in 1954 and his Ph.D. in physics from Caltech in 1960, with a thesis on the photoproduction of negative and positive pions from deuterium. During his military service with the U.S. Army he was stationed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and worked for the Ordnance Corps until 1962. He joined the Caltech faculty in 1962 as an assistant professor, becoming a full professor of physics in 1970. He was named Howard Hughes Professor in 1985 and Chairman of the Division of Physics, Math and Astronomy in 1988. At the time of his death, he was the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Physics, Emeritus and an adjunct faculty member of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. Neugebauer served as the director of the Palomar Observatory from 1980 to 1994. Neugebauer was active in infrared astronomy, and played a leading role in infrared studies of the planets. In addition\u2014and largely through his activities with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC)\u2014he led both ground- and space-based infrared studies of the stars, the Milky Way and other galaxies. Observations by him and his colleagues at Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories revealed thousands of infrared sources in the sky, and afforded the first infrared view of the galactic center. Together with Robert B. Leighton, he completed the Two-Micron Sky Survey, the first infrared survey of the sky, which cataloged more than 5,000 infrared sources. Together with Eric Becklin, he discovered the Becklin\u2013Neugebauer Object, an intense source of infrared radiation in the Orion Nebula that is one of the brightest objects in the sky at wavelengths less than 10 micrometres. Neugebauer played a role in the design and construction of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Among Neugebauer's numerous awards are two NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medals (1972, 1984), the 1985 Space Science Award of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the 1985 Richmyer Lecture Award, the 1986 Rumford Prize, the 1996 Henry Norris Russell Lectureship, the 1998 Herschel Medal, and the 2010 Bruce Medal.

When King Chulalongkorn began his administrative reform programme in 1892, Prince Damrong was chosen to lead the Ministry of the North (\"Mahatthai\"), which was converted into the Ministry of the Interior in 1894.

He, according to William of Apulia, \"equalled in his virtues both the duke and his father.\" In 1071, Jordan briefly rebelled against his father with the support of his uncle, Ranulf. In 1078, while his father was besieging Naples with Robert Guiscard, Jordan and Robert, count of Loritello, were ravaging the Abruzzi, then papal territory. He, his father, and the duke were all excommunicated, when, suddenly, his father fell ill, retired to Capua, reconciled with the church, and died. Jordan, fearing to rule under the ban of the church, called off the siege of Naples and went to Rome to reconcile himself to Pope Gregory VII and rectify his relations with the church, of which his father had been both servant and protector. It appears that he intended to take up the position of his father \"vis-a-vis\" the papacy and to return to unfriendly relations with the duke of Apulia, for Gregory visited Capua a mere three months after Richard's death and Jordan, probably with papal prodding, began fomenting revolt in the Guiscard's lands. The revolt, the widely supported and well-organised, was ineffectual in really curbing Robert's influence and power. One of his chief advisors was the abbot of Montecassino, Desiderius of Benevento, who mediated between the prince and the Emperor Henry IV on the latter's descent into Italy (1081). Jordan forsook his erstwhile papal ally in exchange for an imperial investiture. Though Robert Guiscard and his brother Roger marched against him, Roger was recalled to Sicily and the expedition fell apart. In 1085, on Robert's death, Jordan supported Bohemond, the elder son, over Roger Borsa, the eldest by Sichelgaita, who was his own sister-in-law, he having married Gaitelgrima, another daughter of Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno. For the next three years, Bohemond held Apulia with the assistance of well-trained Capuan armies. In that same year, the pope died and the antipope Clement III continued to claim the papacy. In hopes of curbing the influence of Clement and united his interests with those of the papacy once again, he pressured the College of Cardinals to elect Desiderius of Montecassino as successor Gregory. At the same time, Roger Borsa freed the captured imperial prefect of Rome in opposition to the pretensions of Jordan and the Papal Curia, which had refused confirmation of Roger's archiepiscopal candidate for Salerno. The move backfired and Desiderius, under pressure from Jordan to accept, was elected pope as Victor III. With the aid of armies from Jordan and the Countess Matilda of Tuscany, Victor took the Vatican Hill from Clement on 1 July 1086. The pope remained lukewarm to his new job until Jordan suggested that only through decisive action could the good fortune of his beloved abbey of Montecassino be sustained. This led to an important synod at Benevento (1087), where Clement was excommunicated, lay investiture outlawed, and war with the Saracens of Africa declared. The remainder of Jordan's career was not notable and he died in November 1090 or 1091 in Piperna (near Terracina) and was buried in the monastery he had long supported, Montecassino, leaving a young son named Richard who succeeded him. His other sons, Robert and Jordan, would also succeed to the Capuan throne some day, and he left one unnamed daughter."}

He was the youngest of four sons of Landulf I, gastald of Capua. As a young man, he entered the church. When his father died, his eldest brother, Lando, succeeded him. On the death of the bishop of Capua, Paulinus, Lando made Landulf bishop of the city. Lando died in 861 and his young son, Lando II was deposed only a few months later by Landulf's other elder brother, Pando. Pando too died soon thereafter( 862 or 863) and a succession crisis broke out. Pando's son Pandenulf was shoved aside and Landulf, though bishop, took the Capuan throne in 863. However, the other branches of the family refused to recognize the usurpation and began seizing much of the county for themselves, leaving Landulf II only in control of the town of Capua proper. Isolated, Landulf II invited Saracen mercenaries to ravage the lands of his familiars, a move which much alarmed his neighbors( including the pope). In 866, the deposed Pandenulf appealed to Emperor Louis II, then visiting Monte Cassino, to act against his uncle. The Emperor promptly besieged Capua and divested Landulf II, but instead of restoring Pandenulf, decided to pass the county of Capua over to the marquis Lambert I of Spoleto. This arrangement did not last long. In 871, Lambert was involved in a rebellion against Louis II orchestrated by Adelchis of Benevento. In the aftermath, Louis II deposed Lambert and restored Landulf II as count of Capua. As a condition, Landulf II swore off deploying Saracens in the county. Upon the death of Louis( 875), who had strictly enforced peace amongst the Christians of the Mezzogiorno, Landulf II allied himself with the Saracens, but in 877, Pope John VIII convinced him to ally himself to the papacy against the Muslims. He spent the next years defending the Amalfi Coast with his navy in return for tribute. Landulf II died in 879, undisputed count of Capua, and a succession crisis broke out again between his nephews Lando II( son of Lando), Pandenulf( son of Pando) and Lando III( son of Landenulf of Teano). In the chronicle of Erchempert, of whom he was a contemporary, Landulf II of Capua is the chief villain, portrayed as a dabbler in mysticism and black magic, Saracen ally and enemy of Christendom. Erchempert's portrayal of Landulf II was the inspiration for the character of evil duke and magician Klingsor in Wolfram von Eschenbach's medieval epic\" Parzival\". Eschenbach's epic was later translated into the famous nineteenth- century opera\" Parsifal\" by Richard Wagner. As American film director George Lucas is frequently said to have looked to\" Parsifal\" for inspiration in his creation of the\" Star Wars\" saga, Landulf II of Capua, via this long chain of association, is the closest historical source for the villainous Darth Vader."}

The film is an Italian\u2013American venture produced by The Ladd Company, Embassy International Pictures, PSO Enterprises, and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros. Based on Harry Grey's novel \"The Hoods\", it chronicles the lives of best friends David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years. It is also the third film of Leone's \"Once Upon a Time Trilogy\", which includes \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) and \"Duck, You Sucker!\" (1971). The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the film score by Ennio Morricone. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes, and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement. The shortened version was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes that were made. The original \"European cut\" has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest gangster films of all time."}

It stars Henry Fonda, cast against type, as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader, and Jason Robards as a bandit. The screenplay was written by Sergio Donati and Leone, from a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the acclaimed film score was by Ennio Morricone. After directing\" The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", Leone decided to retire from Westerns and desired to produce his film based on\" The Hoods\", which eventually became\" Once Upon a Time in America\". However, Leone accepted an offer from Paramount Pictures to provide access to Henry Fonda and to use a budget to produce another Western film. He recruited Bertolucci and Argento to devise the plot of the film in 1966, researching other Western films in the process. After Clint Eastwood turned down an offer to play the movie's protagonist, Bronson was offered the role. During production, Leone recruited Donati to rewrite the script due to concerns over time limitations. The original version by the director was 166 minutes( 2 hours and 46 minutes) when it was first released on 21 December 1968. This was the version that was to be shown in European cinemas and was a box office success. For the US release on 28 May 1969,\" Once Upon a Time in the West\" was edited down to 145 minutes( 2 hours and 25 minutes) by Paramount and was a financial flop. The film is the first installment in Leone's\" Once Upon a Time Trilogy\", followed by\" Duck, You Sucker!\" and\" Once Upon a Time in America\", though the films do not share any characters in common. In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being\" culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\"."}

Hutchinson also made a small cameo in the classic New Zealand film as a dairy farmer. He produced other films and television commercials, most recently\" Home by Christmas\" in 2010. Hutchinson, the son of a Royal Air Force pilot, was born in England on 13 July 1941. He began his film career as a press officer for the Walt Disney Company's London office. An original drummer for the British band The Bo Street Runners, Hutchinson left the band to work for Disney full- time. His position in the band was filled by drummer Mick Fleetwood, who later formed Fleetwood Mac. Hutchinson next joined a production company owned by actor David Hemmings. While working with Hemmings, Hutchinson became friends with New Zealand cinematographer, Graeme Cowley. Huctinson and Cowley soon partnered in 1974 to form two film companies based in Wellington, New Zealand \u2013 Film Facilities, a film rental company, and their production company, Motion Pictures Limited. The duo hoped to profit from New Zealand's expanding film and television industries during the 1970s. Hutchinson originally met Geoff Murphy, who had already penned an early, handwritten screenplay for the film that would become\" Goodbye Pork Pie\" through his new production companies. Hutchinson and Cowley soon joined the production as co-producers. Together, Hucthinson, Murphy and Cowlet kept the production on a shoe- string budget of just NZ$ 450,000. Released in 1981,\" Goodbye Pork Pie\" became the first New Zealand- made film to recoup its original budget solely from domestic NZ box office sales. It also became the first New Zealand film to screen at the Cannes Film Festival. Cowley later focused on their Film Facilities rental division, while Nigel Hutchinson directed and produced television commercials. Hutchinson won several international awarded for his commercials, including a Gold Clio Award, a Gold Lion from the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and a Mobies award.

She was a proponent of enlightened absolutism until the advent of the French Revolution, when, in order to prevent its ideas gaining currency, she made Naples a police state. Born an Austrian archduchess, the thirteenth child of Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I , she married Ferdinand as part of an Austrian alliance with Spain, where Ferdinand's father was king. Following the birth of a male heir in 1775, Maria Carolina was admitted to the Privy Council. Thereafter, she dominated it until 1812, when she was sent back to Vienna. Like her mother, Maria Carolina took pains to make politically advantageous marriages for her children. Maria Carolina promoted Naples as a centre of the arts, patronising painters Jacob Philipp Hackert and Angelica Kauffman and academics Gaetano Filangieri, Domenico Cirillo and Giuseppe Maria Galanti. Maria Carolina, abhorring how the French treated their queen, her sister Marie Antoinette, allied Naples with Britain and Austria during the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary Wars. As a result of a failed Neapolitan invasion of French-occupied Rome, she fled to Sicily with her husband in December 1798. One month later, the Parthenopean Republic was declared, which repudiated Bourbon rule in Naples for six months. Deposed as Queen of Naples for a second time by French forces, in 1806, Maria Carolina died in Vienna in 1814, a year before her husband's restoration to Naples."}

Ballard", "context": "James Graham Ballard (15 November 193019 April 2009) was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist who first became associated with the New Wave of science fiction for his post-apocalyptic novels such as \"The Wind from Nowhere\" (1961) and \"The Drowned World\" (1962). In the late 1960s, he produced a variety of experimental short stories (or \"condensed novels\"), such as those collected in the controversial \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" (1970). In the mid 1970s, Ballard published several novels, among them the highly controversial \"Crash\" (1973), a story about symphorophilia and car crash fetishism, and \"High-Rise\" (1975), a depiction of a luxury apartment building's descent into violent chaos. While much of Ballard's fiction would prove thematically and stylistically provocative, he became best known for his relatively conventional war novel, \"Empire of the Sun\" (1984), a semi-autobiographical account of a young British boy's experiences in Shanghai during Japanese occupation. Described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the best British novel about the Second World War\", the story was adapted into a 1987 film by Steven Spielberg starring Christian Bale. In the following decades until his death in 2009, Ballard's work shifted toward the form of the traditional crime novel. Several of his earlier works have been adapted into films, including David Cronenberg's controversial 1996 adaptation of \"Crash\" and Ben Wheatley's 2015 adaptation of \"High-Rise\". The literary distinctiveness of Ballard's fiction has given rise to the adjective \"Ballardian\", defined by the \"Collins English Dictionary\" as \"resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in J. G. Ballard's novels and stories, especially dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments\". The \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" entry describes Ballard's work as being occupied with \"eros, thanatos, mass media and emergent technologies\"."}

When Badi-al Zaman's father died in 1549, he, along with his other siblings were taken care of by Tahmasp, who even announced Badi-al Zaman as his own son. Badi al-Zaman was appointed as the governor of Sistan in 1557, and married Pari Khan Khanum (who was at that time 10 years old). However, since she was Tahmasp's favored daughter, she was not allowed to go alongside her husband to Sistan. According to the other historians, however, Pari Khan Khanum was only engaged to Badi al-Zaman, which according to Gholsorkhi seems more believable. Allegedly the marriage went no farther, since Pari Khan Khanum chose a bureaucratic life in the capital, alongside her father, over married life in Sistan.

Also born in 1702 was another illegitimate child of the duke, Jean Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, by a lady-in-waiting, Madame d'Argenton. Ang\u00e9lique's half-brother was legitimised in 1706, whereas Ang\u00e9lique was neither acknowledged nor recognized, although Madame du Prat erroneously states in her memoirs that she was recognized on 22 April 1722, the same day as the abb\u00e9 de Saint-Albin, another illegitimate son of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans by his mistress Florence Pellerin.

He lived in an \"h\u00f4tel\" in Passy, Paris on a beautiful ten-acre property, which later passed to the Duchess of Valentinois and was named \"H\u00f4tel de Valentinois\" after her. (The property is famous for being the residence of Benjamin Franklin for nearly ten years.) They had at least five children: Ang\u00e9lique died in Paris 1785 at 83 years of age, and was buried at the \u00c9glise Saint-Eustache, Paris."}
